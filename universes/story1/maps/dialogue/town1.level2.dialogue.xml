I know exactly where I made the note about where you can go to customize your controls, but unfortunately I have a hard time reading in low light conditions.  If you would just give me one more [color=special]gold piece[/color], I could use its shiny aura to help me read this journal entry.

Please help, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!

																				Thanks, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I can read it easily now!

Listen closely!  You can customize your controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color].  You can also do it in the [color=special]main menu[/color], but you would have to quit this game session to do that!

																				You're starting to scare me, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I feel like I must have somehow offended your delicate sensibilities, but I promise you that I am only trying to help you to customize your controls!

Here, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I'm going to give you all of the gold back right now.  Also, you can customize your controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color].  You can also do it in the [color=special]main menu[/color], but you would have to quit this game session to do that!

																			<comment>[color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], I told you about how much trouble I have reading in these low light conditions.

								You already customized your controls, didn't you, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?

What a shame.

I had this incredibly [color=special]elaborate discussion[/color] ready -- you would pay me increasing amounts of gold, and in return I would have finally told you that you can customize your controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color].  Regrettably, you have already customized your controls and thus I can't run that by you.

Have you considered temporarily renaming your [color=special]controls.xml[/color] file and then returning to me once more?

							<comment>[color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], did I ever tell you that I had these [color=special]shoes[/color] custom fit?  I think that everyone should have the chance to customize things, even the simple things like gameplay controls.  You could probably do that in the [color=special]pause menu[/color] right now!</comment>

							<comment>I wouldn&apos;t have lost so much sleep over these shoes if I hadn&apos;t spent so many gold pieces having them custom fit recently! You probably know exactly what I mean after using the [color=special]pause menu[/color] to custom fit your gameplay controls!</comment>
