                [l id = 'line1'] When I gave you that bomb, $player$, I saw the look on your face.  Yes, I was going to use that bomb to coerce $Jill$ into marrying me against her free will. \
                    And yes, you're right, I do have a lot more bombs.  I was obviously going to need a lot of them to keep her with me until the ink dried.

                    I'll share some more of them with you, because you clearly expected something more than 1 lousy bomb for completing that quest for me...

                [n id = 'nag4'] Every once in a while I just give some gold away, don't I?  If you talk to me enough, you can have all of the gold you want!

                [n id = 'nag5'] You only have a 20% chance of getting a gold bar from me as a result of my excessive jubilance.  How desperately do you want some more gold, $player$?

                [n id = 'nag1'] I'm thinking of using this $bomb$ I bought to coerce her into loving me.  What do you think, $player$?

                [n id = 'nag2'] I just need to find a way to force $Jill$ to love me.

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I can't believe I had you of all people deliver that letter, $player$.  When $Jill$ noticed that \
                    I had sent an amateur -- someone who has not even customized their controls in the $pause menu$ -- she probably decided then and there to move on with her life!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I know you've spent some time in the control customization screen, $player$.  By any chance, did you \
                    see a key in there that could force $Jill$ to marry me after all?

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] You killed the only woman I ever loved, $player$.  Why?

                [n id = 'nag2'] I should have taken that love letter to her myself.  Maybe I didn't really love her after all...

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] People like you don't deserve access to $bombs$, $player$.  Someone should make a law that forbids \
                    anyone who hasn't customized their controls in the $pause menu$ from having bombs!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] If I had the power, $player$, I would disable the $@bomb$ key on your input device of choice.  I would!
