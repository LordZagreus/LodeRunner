                [l id = 'line1'] Hi, $player$!  Have you noticed that most people around here have a lot to say?  Every time you talk to them, they start in on something else!

                [l id = 'line2'] Personally, I think people talk as much as they do just to keep their mind off of the ^Bungeling Emperor^.  I've seen his powerful bad guys destroy many of my friends.

                [l id = 'line3'] By the way, $player$, have you tried to complete the $puzzle room$ on this level yet?  I hear you win a special prize for completing puzzle rooms, but I've never figured out how to beat one of them.

                [l id = 'line4'] I'm a little bit tired of talking to you, $player$.  I think you should be trying to save us from the bad guys right now.

                [l id = 'line5'] $player$, why do you keep pestering me?  I really have to concentrate to stay on this predefined path, and you're not helping matters.  What do I have \
                    to do to get you to leave me alone, $player$?

                    +gold Give me 20 pieces of gold.

                        >>> root.gold

                            [l id = 'line1'] If I give you gold just because you asked for it, then you'll just keep asking for more.  Forget it, $player$!

                    +item Give me a cool item.

                        >>> root.item

                            [l id = 'line1'] You expect a cool item from one of the first NPCs in the game?  I have only a few meager possessions, but you can probably use anything \
                                against the ^Bungeling empire^.  I'll give you one of my old items at random, but I don't think it'll impress you very much!

                                @post-script
                                    player().acquireRandomItem("carloss-heavy-bracelet", "carloss-lucky-headband", "carloss-baby-turtle");

                    +bye Sorry.  I'll leave you alone.

                        >>> root.bye

                            [l id = 'line1'] I don't really believe you, $player$.  Let me give you these $10 gold pieces$, just to make sure you mean it!

                                @post-script
                                    player().addGold(10);

                [n id = 'nag1'] I am currently saying meaningless things in random order.

                [n id = 'nag2'] Notice that I am saying meaningless things in random order.

                [n id = 'nag3'] If you keep talking to me, you will see only meaningless things in random order.

                [n id = 'nag4'] The meaningless things I say, I say them randomly.

                [n id = 'nag5'] At random, I will say one of a handful of meaningless phrases.

                [n id = 'nag6'] Talking to me will get you nothing but meaningless phrases uttered at random.

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] You know, I haven't seen Carlos around lately.

                [n id = 'nag2'] I wonder what ever happened to Carlos.  Did I ever mention that I used to have strong feelings for him?  Before you blew him up, of course!


        @conversation[id = 'quest:pending:assign']

            >>> root

                [l id = 'line1'] Welcome to our humble town, $player$!  My name is $Rochelle$.  I would offer to show you around town, but we don't even have a single $merchant$ to buy things from!

                    I'd like to ask you a favor, $player$, but I don't feel like I know you well enough yet.  Maybe if we get to know each other a little bit better, I'll feel more comfortable...

                [l id = 'line2'] Thanks for taking such an interest in me, $player$.  I almost feel like I can trust you with anything.  All of these ^bad guys^ that are running around in the wild areas, though, \
                    scare me pretty bad!

                    I really appreciate having you around to talk to in times like this.  Maybe you can stop by again soon?  I want to ask you about that favor, but I'm still trying to find the words...

                [l id = 'line3'] $player$, I have to talk to you about something.  Have you talked to $Carlos$ up there?  I can't stop looking at him!

                    I don't feel confident enough to approach him yet, though.  If I had a nice $perfume$, I would feel much more at ease.

                [n id = 'nag1'] Have you visited $Amandria$ yet?  If you go there, you should find a merchant that is selling my favorite perfume.

                    Do you think you can help me, $player$?  I will surely reward you with a wonderful and useful item!

                    +yes I'll do my best.

                        >>> root.yes

                            [l id = 'line1'] I don't have much money, $player$, but take these $25 pieces of gold$ as an early token of gratitude.  Please hurry back with the perfume!

                [n id = 'nag1'] Have you had a chance to visit $Amandria$ yet, $player$?  You will find a merchant there selling the perfume!

                [n id = 'nag2'] I would go to $Amandria$ myself to buy the perfume I want, but all of the ^bad guys^ make traveling so treacherous!

                [n id = 'nag1'] I haven't seen $Carlos$ around lately, $player$!  I hope he's doing okay!  Please make sure to bring that $perfume$ to me still!

                [n id = 'nag2'] Where has $Carlos$ gone, I wonder?  If you bring me that $perfume$, maybe he will come back!


        @conversation[id = 'quest:complete:killed-carlos']

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] I think $Carlos$ has gone on a vacation.  Maybe he didn't like the smell of this wonderful perfume.  Do you think I sent you after the wrong perfume, $player$?

                [n id = 'nag2'] $player$, I can't find Carlos anymore.  I don't know what to do with all of this perfume now!

                [l id = 'line1' class = 'default'] You bought the perfume, $player$!  I can't believe it!  I bet $Carlos$ will absolutely love this perfume.  Can I have it now, please?!

                    +yes Here you go, $Rochelle$.

                            [l id = 'line1'] Thank you so much, $player$!

                                I don't think I could ever truly repay you for your kindness, but I can at least offer you this $special item$.  Hopefully it can help you \
                                against the ^Bungeling empire^!

                            [l id = 'line1'] No!  Why did you do that, $player$?!  Why would you spend the gold to buy the perfume, then spill it on the ground right in front of me?!

                    pilfered that extra gold from me when you took the job.

                    All the same, I bet $Carlos$ will absolutely love this perfume.  Can I have it now, please?!

                                going to offer you this $not-so-special item$ as a token of my indifference.

                                Hopefully it can help you in your quest to extort gold out of everyone else in $Lelandria$.

                [n id = 'nag2'] I had another $Carlos dream$ last night, $player$.  I will never have a $Carlos$ in my life without that perfume.
