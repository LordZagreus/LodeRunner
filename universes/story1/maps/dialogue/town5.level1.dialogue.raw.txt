                [l id = 'line1'] Hi, $player$.  I moved here when the ^bad guys^ showed up.  Have you seen a handsome man named $Timmy$ around these parts, a little bit to the $east$, by any chance?

                [n id = 'nag1'] I wonder where $Timmy$ and everyone else went when the ^bad guys^ showed up.  I hope everyone is doing okay!

                [n id = 'nag2'] I like this place, but I don't know how long we can stay here.  I miss $Timmy$ a lot, too.  Please save us from the ^Bungeling empire^, $player$!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] After the ^bad guys^ showed up, I had to abandon my previous home to move here for safety.  I haven't \
                    had time to $customize$ anything yet because I forgot to bring my $pause menu$ with me.  Do you still have access to yours, $player$?

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I tried to convince $Timmy$ to customize his movement controls once, but he never took the time to try it out.  After \
                    you save $Lelandria$, maybe you'll have time to walk him through the process!

                [l id = 'line1'] Did you get this letter from $Timmy$? Let me take a moment to read it...

                [l id = 'line2'] Thank you so much for delivering this to me, $player$!  I've waited for this day, waited so long!  Please take this \
                    $Ring of Eternal Love$ back to $Timmy$ so that he knows I feel just as strongly as he does!

                    Thank you, $player$!

                [n id = 'nag1'] I can't wait to reunite with $Timmy$.  Please keep him safe from the ^Bungeling empire^!

                [n id = 'nag2'] Why don't the ^bad guys^ just leave us alone?  I have a wedding to plan!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] If you decide to customize your gameplay controls in the $pause menu$, $player$, you can also take a look \
                    at the ring before you deliver it to $Timmy$!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Did you have any trouble when you customized your controls, $player$?  I remember $Timmy$ always had a really hard \
                    time figuring it out.
