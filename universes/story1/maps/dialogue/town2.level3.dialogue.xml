								Welcome to [color=special]Navarra[/color], [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  My name is [color=special]Elizabeth[/color].  I work as a banker, controlling various financial institutions throughout all of [color=special]Lelandria[/color].

I have a lot of money, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], but I'm always looking for more.  Most of the peasants around here don't have much money, but the [color=special]merchants[/color] are really rolling in gold, thanks to the threat of the [color=dim]Bungeling empire[/color].

								I'd like to get my hands on some of that gold, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  You can help!  I'd like you to visit at least [color=special]3 merchants[/color] and inform them of a new tax I'm enforcing.  Collect their [color=dim]tithes[/color] and return the gold to me.

I'll make sure to reward you with a very special [color=special]item[/color] when you're done, of course.

											<comment>I like your attitude, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  If you&apos;d like, you can collect a tithe from every merchant in the game, netting yourself a neat little profit in all of this.  I just need [color=special]3 tithes[/color] to satisfy my lust for gold, though!</comment>

												I don't do [color=dim]free[/color], [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  Take these [color=special]5 bombs[/color], but now I'll need you to ask for a little bit more gold from each merchant to cover the cost of what I'm giving you.

I do suspect you'll get the job done.

												You didn't do the job like I asked, but in the end you have what I wanted.  This gold will do just fine, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!

I think this [color=special]special item[/color] will suit you very well, a player that likes to take [color=special]shortcuts[/color] to get results quickly.
