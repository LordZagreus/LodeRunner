                [l id = 'line1'] Welcome to $Amandria$!

                    I've been waiting for you to make it this far. $player$.  I want to send a $special item$ to a friend of mine, but I can't risk doing it myself with all of the ^bad guys^ running around.
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line2'] My friend $JoAnna$ lives in small village just a little bit $northeast$ of here, $player$. \
                    If you would kindly deliver this $special item$ to her, she and I would both appreciate it!

                    What do you say, $player$?

                    +yes I'll do it.

                        >>> root.yes

                            [l id = 'line1'] I can't thank you enough, $player$.

                                After thinking about what I could send to her, I decided to go with this, ^$[1.1.npc1.quest:item-title]^!  Of course, you can try it out \
                                en route to delivering it to $JoAnna$.  Just make sure she gets it, $player$!

                            [l id = 'line1'] You didn't look so greedy when I first saw you, $player$.  I don't think I can trust a truly $special item$ with such a greedy player as you.  After all, \
                                I want to make sure that it eventually ends up in $JoAnna$'s hands.

                                I'm going to have to reach down into the bottom of the barrel here, $player$.  Take a look at this, ^$[1.1.npc1.quest:item-title]^.  I had a better version, \
                                but I won't trust you with it.  If you'd like to try it out en route to delivering it, go ahead, but try to find enough traces of honor within your soul \
                                to deliver it to $JoAnna$ instead of keeping it, $player$.

                                Of course, I'll also include the $50 gold pieces$ you so humbly requested!

                [n id = 'nag1'] Make your way to $Navarra$, $player$.  I gave you some extra gold, and I expect you to at least deliver that item promptly to $JoAnna$.

                [n id = 'nag2'] You'd better find a way to deliver that $item$ I gave you to my friend in $Navarra$.  I don't want to find out I paid that extra fee for nothing!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I see that you haven't bothered to customize your controls yet, $player$.  I suppose you are waiting for someone to give you more gold to do that, too!

                    anything to protect her?  I did everything I could, didn't I?

                    Well, I guess she won't be needing that $item$ I gave you anymore.  You can give it back to me now, $player$.

                                I'll know better than to ask you to deliver an item for me next time, though.  Take these $50 gold pieces$ and leave me to commiserate!

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1' class = 'delivered'] I hear the ^bad guys^ got the better of my friend $JoAnna$.  She sounded very pleased with the item you delivered for her, $player$.  I wonder why it didn't protect her!

                [n id = 'nag2' class = 'delivered'] I wonder if I should have sent even more items to $JoAnna$.  Did you see how the ^bad guys^ got her, $player$?  I can't figure it out!

                [n id = 'nag3' class = 'bought'] From what I've heard, $player$, some of the ^bad guys^ must have gotten ahold of $JoAnna$.  She said you gave her that item I sent with you, but I'm starting to wonder...

                [n id = 'nag4' class = 'bought'] How could the ^bad guys^ have gotten to my friend $JoAnna$?  That item really should have protected her!

                [n id = 'nag5' class = 'default'] I wonder how the ^bad guys^ made it into a town area.  Maybe $JoAnna$ was looking for food outside of town when they got her!

                [n id = 'nag6' class = 'default'] I've heard rumors of someone who looks like you striking down a lot of talking people.  Don't let him get you too, $player$!

                [n id = 'nag7' class = 'extorted'] I wonder how the ^bad guys^ made it into a town area.  I bet you had something to do with it, $player$.  Took a little money on the side to let them in, I bet!

                [n id = 'nag8' class = 'extorted'] I've heard rumors of someone who looks like you striking down a lot of talking people.  Whoever that guy is, I bet he frequently extorts extra gold out of people after failing their quests, too.

                [n id = 'nag1'] I heard from $JoAnna$ that she received my $item$, or something like that.  Thanks for doing the job for me, $player$!

                [n id = 'nag2'] $player$, I wish I knew how to outsmart the ^bad guys^ like you do.  Thanks for getting past them and delivering that item to $JoAnna$ for me!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I know you delivered that item to $JoAnna$ as quickly as possible, $player$, and I most certainly \
                    appreciate it!  I wonder, though:  could you have delivered it even more quickly if you had customized your controls in the $pause menu$?

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I don't have a single doubt that you took full advantage of your customized controls when you delivered that \

                [n id = 'nag1'] I don't think I'll be doing business with you again, $player$.  You didn't do anything good for me on that last endeavor.

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I still can't believe that you killed $JoAnna$.  Have you considered pressing the $@bomb$ key and then standing perfectly \
                    still for a few seconds, $player$?

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Not only did you kill my innocent friend $JoAnna$, but you obviously knew exactly what you were doing!  After all, you \
                    have clearly taken the initiative of customizing your controls!  You know that the $@bomb$ key drops bombs, and you definitely know what they do!

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] Do you just go around killing everyone indiscriminately, $player$?  Why haven't you gotten rid of me yet?

                [n id = 'nag2'] I was going to give you an item to take to $JoAnna$.  If you hadn't killed her so quickly, you could have sampled the item during delivery, \
                    and in theory you could have decided to keep it forever!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Yes, you do look like a ^calculating^ person to me, $player$.  You plan everything ahead of time:  customizing controls, \
                    stealing gold, and killing innocent civilians!
