                [l id = 'line1'] Have you spent any time shopping with $Alice$ yet, $player$?  She does a good job, but I think I could do a better job.  I don't want \
                    to directly compete with her, though.  I wouldn't make enough money, so currently I'm not working as a $merchant$.

                    If she went out of business, though...
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line2' class = 'prompt'] Look, $player$.  I like $Alice$, and I don't want to see anything bad happen to her.  If you can, find a way to shut her down without \
                    hurting her.  Hopefully you don't have to send her packing!

                    Once you have taken care of things, I will eagerly show you how much better work I can do as a $merchant$!

                    +ok[class = 'default'] I'll get it done, $Logan$.

                            [l id = 'line1'] I didn't want to see that happen, $player$!  What reason did you have to do that to $Alice$, one of the nicest girls in town?  I thought \
                                you were going to fight against the ^Bungeling empire^, not alongside them!

                                Still, I will take this opportunity to start my own $merchant business$.  Given the circumstances, I don't feel like importing special items, but you should still \
                                appreciate the $items$ I'm carrying.  Please stop by anytime!

                    Can you help me out yet?

                    +ok[class = 'default'] I'll get to it now, $Logan$.

                    +later[class = 'default'] Not right now...

                [n id = 'nag1'] Have you found a way to put $Alice$ out of business without hurting her, $player$?

                [n id = 'nag2'] I'd love to work as a $merchant$, but I can't do so while $Alice$ is selling items.

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Go ahead and customize your gameplay controls in the $pause menu$ when you have a chance.  $Alice$ increased \
                    her sales by $200%$ when she customized her controls, and I bet I can do even better if I start up a shoppe of my own!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I like what you've done with your customized controls, $player$.  I might have to try those out some day!

                [l id = 'line1'] Did you think I wouldn't see that, $player$?  I told you I didn't want anything bad to happen to $Alice$.  I guess I should have known better.

                    Still, I will take this opportunity to start my own $merchant business$.  Given the circumstances, I didn't have enough time to import special items, but you will still \
                    love the $items$ I'm carrying.  Please stop by anytime!

                [l id = 'line1'] Thanks for taking care of things with grace, $player$.  I do like $Alice$, and I'm glad she'll be staying around as a civilian.

                    Like I said before, I'm going to go ahead and start working as a $merchant$ now.  Knowing $Alice$ would be sticking around, I took the time \
                    to order some $extra special$ items that you will totally love!  Make sure to stop back to see what I have in stock!

                            [l id = 'line1'] I have to admit, $player$, that I haven't been doing a lot of business lately.  My usual customers can't travel as freely with all of the \
                                ^bad guys^ running amok.  I wish I could refuse your offer, but I could really use that kind of money.

                                I think we have a deal, $player$!  Thanks for the generous offer you made me.  Good luck against the ^Bungeling empire^!

                [n id = 'nag2'] I hear $Logan$ set up a new business down there.  Good for him!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Now that I am not selling items, I have plenty of time to customize my movement controls in the $pause menu$.  Have \
                    you tried it out yet, $player$?

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] After you gave me so many gold pieces to close my shoppe, I decided to hire a consultant to help me customize my movement \
                    controls.  I bet you didn't need any help when you changed yours, though!
