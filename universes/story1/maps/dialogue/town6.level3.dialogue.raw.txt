                [n id = 'nag1' priority = '10'] If you keep heading to the west, you'll eventually reach the town of $Manderkeen$.  \
                                                Sounds like a plan, oh bearded one!

                [n id = 'nag2'] I tried to buy some bombs from $Biggins$ yesterday, but I couldn't understand what he was saying!

                [n id = 'nag3'] I hope you can get rid of the ^bad guys^ soon, $player$.  I really miss being able to travel without fearing for my life!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] You can use the $pause menu$ to customize your controls at any time, $player$!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Keep an eye out for the town of $Manderkeen$ as you move to the west with your customized \
                    controls, $player$.

                                If you keep heading $west$, you'll find a guy named $Jake$ up in $Manderkeen$.  He has a lot of contacts in the shipping world, \
                                and he's using them to deny me access to some really great $items$.

                            [l id = 'line2' class = 'prompt'] If you were to scatter his pixels, I bet I could bring in some very excellent items for you.  What do you say, $player$?

                                +yes[class = 'default'] I'll give him your regards.
