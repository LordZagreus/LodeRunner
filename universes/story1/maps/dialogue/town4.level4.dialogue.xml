								I can't believe you've made it this far already, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!

Have you talked to my sister, [color=special]Sierra[/color], just on the north side of this town?  I haven't had a chance to speak with her recently, and I'm worried about her business.

Here, take these [color=special]50 gold pieces[/color] to give to her, and I&apos;ll give you [color=special]5 free bombs[/color] in case you run into [color=dim]bad guys[/color] on the way up there.  I appreciate this!</comment>

											<comment>Wow, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  I can&apos;t believe you&apos;d do that for me!  Please take this [color=special]special item[/color] before you go.  I&apos;ve been saving it for a [color=special]hero[/color] like you, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  It has a lot of special attributes.  A couple of them sound a little bit dangerous, such as the increased enemy speed, but I think you&apos;ll like it all the same!</comment>

												I... don't know what to say, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I never told anyone this, but I found out a while back that [color=special]Sierra[/color] was secretly smuggling inventory to the [color=dim]Bungeling emperor[/color]. You must have figured that out somehow, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].

I didn't want to tell anyone about Sierra because she's my loving sister, but I guess I don't have to keep secrets any more.  Too bad things didn't work out better for her!

											<comment>I&apos;m going to give you this [color=special]strange item[/color] my sister received from the [color=dim]Bungeling emperor[/color].  The [color=dim]bad guys[/color] were going to use it, which means it has some really bad properties, like making the [color=dim]bad guys[/color] faster.  It has some other interesting properties too, though.  Try it and see!</comment>
