                [l id = 'line1'] Welcome to $Navarra$, $player$.  My name is $Elizabeth$.  I work as a banker, controlling various financial institutions throughout all of $Lelandria$.

                    I have a lot of money, $player$, but I'm always looking for more.  Most of the peasants around here don't have much money, but \
                    the $merchants$ are really rolling in gold, thanks to the threat of the ^Bungeling empire^.
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line2'] I'd like to get my hands on some of that gold, $player$.  You can help!  I'd like you to visit at least $3 merchants$ and \
                    inform them of a new tax I'm enforcing.  Collect their ^tithes^ and return the gold to me.

                    I'll make sure to reward you with a very special $item$ when you're done, of course.

                    +yes Sure thing, ma'am!

                        >>> root.yes

                            [l id = 'line1'] I like your attitude, $player$.  If you'd like, you can collect a tithe from every merchant in the game, netting yourself a neat little profit \
                                in all of this.  I just need $3 tithes$ to satisfy my lust for gold, though!

                            [l id = 'line1'] I don't do ^free^, $player$.  Take these $5 bombs$, but now I'll need you to ask for a little bit more gold from each merchant to cover the cost of what I'm giving you.

                                I do suspect you'll get the job done.

                [n id = 'nag1'] Welcome back, $player$.  I'm still looking for somebody to collect that new $tax$ for me.  Have you had enough time to think it over?

                    +yes Yes.  I'll collect the taxes for you now.

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Have you made up your mind yet, $player$?  You're definitely not too busy customizing your controls \
                    in the $pause menu$ yet.  You must have plenty of spare time, then, to collect that new $tax$ for me!

                    +yes Yes.  I'll collect the taxes for you now.

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I'm still waiting for your decision, $player$.  Don't try to tell me you're too busy customizing your controls; I can \
                    tell you've already done that.  Will you finally agree to collect that new $tax$ for me?

                [n id = 'nag1'] Keep collecting those tithes, $player$.  I don't want those merchants getting so wealthy that they no longer need me to lend them money at high interest rates!

                            [l id = 'line1'] You didn't do the job like I asked, but in the end you have what I wanted.  This gold will do just fine, $player$!

                                I think this $special item$ will suit you very well, a player that likes to take $shortcuts$ to get results quickly.

                                that takes the time to do a job right.  Enjoy!

                            [n id = 'nag1'] Suit yourself, $player$.  Let me know when you have the $tithes$ ready for me.

                            [n id = 'nag2'] I need that tithe money, $player$.  Bring it to me when you have it!

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] I enjoyed doing business with you, $player$.

                [n id = 'nag2'] Thanks for helping me amass more gold, $player$.  I am always looking for more!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] The merchants around here will file complaints against me when they discover the truth \
                    about that phony tax.  Wait until they learn that a player using the default gameplay controls cheated them out of all that gold!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Cheating all of those merchants out of their gold took even less time than customizing your controls, didn't it, $player$? \
                    We'll have to try this again if I make it to the sequel alive!
