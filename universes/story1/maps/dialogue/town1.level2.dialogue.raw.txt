                [n id = 'nag1' priority = '5'] Have you tried entering that puzzle room yet, $player$?  I did try solving it one time, but I never could \
                                               master the technique of $digging bricks beneath bridges$.  Maybe you can do it!

                [n id = 'nag2' priority = '0'] We are all rooting for you to defeat the ^Bungeling emperor^'s henchmen and save $Lelandria$.  On the side, \
                                               I'm rooting for you to use one of your bombs on $Jackson$ down there.  I have nothing to reward you with, regrettably.

                [n id = 'nag3'] Do you know that the original ruler of $Lelandria$ had a different name for this place?  Yeah!  He called it $graph$.  What a strange name to choose!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Have you gotten used to the game controls by now, $player$?  You can choose to customize them in the \
                    $pause menu$ at any time!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] With your expertly set control scheme, $player$, you should have no trouble at all in the puzzle room on this level!  \
                    You might have already completed it, even!

        @conversation[id = 'kept-shoes']

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1' priority = '10'] Don't tell anyone, $player$, but I personally think those shoes look much better on you than they ever looked on $Jackson$.  \
                                                I think you'll find them very useful against the ^bad guys^, too!

                [n id = 'nag2' priority = '5'] On second thought, I don't care what you say to $Jackson$.  I never cared much for the guy!

                [n id = 'nag3'] I thought about trying to steal $Jackson$'s shoes from the puzzle room one time.  After I got ahold of them, I would have sold them to him \
                                at a highly exorbinant price.  Unfortunately, I never mastered the art of $digging bricks directly beneath bridges$!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Be careful not to lose those shoes that you stole from $Jackson$.  Between you and me, I think he \
                    would have never lost them if he had taken the time to customize his controls in the $pause menu$.  Have you thought about trying that, too?

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Do you know that $Jackson$ never even took the time to customize his controls?  He can only blame himself, then, \
                    for how easily he lost his precious $shoes$ in that puzzle room.  Only a true hero like you, $player$ -- with your smartly customized controls and your expert strategy -- only you deserve to wear \
                    such fine shoes!


        @conversation[id = 'killed-jackson']

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1' priority = '10'] I saw what you did to $Jackson$ down there.  Don't feel too bad about it, $player$.  The ^bad guys^ were \
                                                going to get him sooner or later, anyway!

                [n id = 'nag2'] $Jackson$ liked to steal gold too, just like the ^bad guys^.  He lost those shoes of his when he was trying to figure out \
                                how to get all of the gold out of that puzzle room!

                [n id = 'nag3'] Have you talked to $Isabella$ just next door?  She made good money selling new outfits to $Jackson$.  Never underestimate the \
                                profit potential bred within desperate materialism!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] After thinking about things longer, I've become even $more$ impressed at how quickly you decided to \
                    kill $Jackson$.  You didn't even delay long enough to customize your controls before dispatching him from this world!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I wish I had been there when you pressed $@bomb$ to explode him down there, $player$.  Wait -- did you simply let \
                    him walk off the level by digging the ground in front of him?  I really wish I had seen it, either way!

                [n id = 'nag1'] I would have given you the gold, $player$, but you didn't bring back my $running shoes$.

                [n id = 'nag2'] My $running shoes$ would look a lot better on you than whatever other item you selected instead!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] You $still$ haven't customized your controls, $player$?  I wonder who will suffer next as you pretend to \
                    save us from the ^Bungeling empire^!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Next time you promise to help somebody recover a lost item, $player$, I hope you can find a way to \
                    hold true to your word.  Maybe you need to make some additional customizations to your controls in the $pause menu$, because the settings you chose last time just didn't get the job done!

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] I hope you're making good use of those $running shoes$, $player$!

                [n id = 'nag2'] I remember how $fast$ I used to run while wearing those $running shoes$.  I miss them so much!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Do you realize, $player$, that I paid a lot of gold pieces to a cobbler to custom fit those shoes for my feet? \
                    Wow!  You wouldn't know anything about $customization$, though, would you?  You haven't even customized your controls in the $pause menu$ yet!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Do you remember the time you spent customizing your controls in the $pause menu$, $player$?  I spent that same amount \
                    of time getting a custom fit for those $shoes$ you kept from me!  I really wish you had given them to me!

                [l id = 'line1'] Thanks for that gold you gave me, $player$!  I finally won an online auction, meaning I should have some perfect new shoes in a matter of days!

                [n id = 'nag1'] I thought about asking you for a few more pieces of gold so that I could spring for overnight shipping, but you probably wouldn't have gone for that.

                [n id = 'nag2'] When will my new $shoes$ finally get here?  I can hardly wait!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Thanks for that gold, $player$.  I need just a little bit more to buy some custom fit shoelaces, though.  If you \
                    will give me $25 gold pieces$, then I will tell you where you can customize your controls!

                    What do you say, $player$?

                    +yes[min-gold = '25'] Sure, $Jackson$.  Take this gold!

                                As I promised, I will now tell you where you can customize your controls.  I wrote it all down somewhere, but I can't remember where I put my journal!  I suspect that if you gave me another \
                                $10 gold pieces$ I would immediately remember where I put it!

                                +sucker[min-gold = '10'] Not a problem, $Jackson$.  Here you go!

                                        [n id = 'nag1'] I've found it, $player$!  I've found the journal.  I know exactly where I made the note about where you can go to customize your controls, but unfortunately I have a hard \
                                            time reading in low light conditions.  If you would just give me one more $gold piece$, I could use its shiny aura to help me read this journal entry.

                                            Please help, $player$!

                            [n id = 'nag1'] You already know that you can customize your controls using the $pause menu$, then?  Please don't tell anybody else!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] You already customized your controls, didn't you, $player$?

                    What a shame.

                    I had this incredibly $elaborate discussion$ \
                    ready -- you would pay me increasing amounts of gold, and in return I would have finally told you that you can customize your controls in the $pause menu$.  Regrettably, you have already customized your \
                    controls and thus I can't run that by you.

                    Have you considered temporarily renaming your $controls.xml$ file and then returning to me once more?

                [n id = 'nag1'] I love these $running shoes$, $player$!  I think they make me a little faster!

                [n id = 'nag2'] These $running shoes$ make all the difference, $player$.  Thanks for bringing them back to me!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] $player$, did I ever tell you that I had these $shoes$ custom fit?  I think that everyone should have the chance \
                    to customize things, even the simple things like gameplay controls.  You could probably do that in the $pause menu$ right now!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I wouldn't have lost so much sleep over these shoes if I hadn't spent so many gold pieces having them custom fit recently! \
                    You probably know exactly what I mean after using the $pause menu$ to custom fit your gameplay controls!
