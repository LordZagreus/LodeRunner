								Thanks for visiting us here in [color=special]Navarra[/color], [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I bet you've noticed a lot of the danger and violence in [color=special]Lelandria[/color].  The [color=dim]Bungeling empire[/color] is threatening every mile of our beautiful country.

Not too long ago, we all lived peacefully, in harmony.  Everything feels so different now, though.  I wish the [color=dim]bad guys[/color] would leave.

								Something else bothers me even more, though, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].

A merchant [color=special]somewhere to the west[/color] decided to install a series of [color=special]bomb vending machines[/color] in numerous locations.  You probably have seen some of them already.  Maybe you even bought some bombs from them, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].

The guy who installed the machines -- a guy named [color=dim]Kenny[/color] -- is deviously profiting from the violence in our once-quiet land.  Instead of trying to negotiate with the [color=dim]Bungeling empire[/color], we are selling bombs!

								If you happen to visit [color=special]Callistaska[/color] in your travels, find [color=dim]Kenny[/color].  Find him and destroy him!  I know it won't stop people from using his [color=special]bomb vending machines[/color], but at least no one will profit from them.

If you do get rid of him, stop back to see me.  I want to reward whomever takes that guy out with a very [color=special]special item[/color].

												Do you think that would work, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?  You'd still profit from the vending machines yourself after buying his contracts, and I don't know if I'd like that any better.  However, I do suppose you need all of the [color=special]gold[/color] you can get to save us from the [color=dim]Bungeling emperor[/color].

Here, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  Take these [color=special]50 gold pieces[/color] and see what you can do.  Honestly, I really want you to get rid of [color=dim]Kenny[/color], whatever you end up doing.  I'll have that [color=special]special item[/color] waiting for you if you do it.

												You did a great job, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I didn't even realize you had gotten rid of him already!

As a reward, I have a [color=special]special item[/color] for you.  I chose it at random from my best selection, and I think you'll really like it.  Put it to good use, and try to save us all from the [color=dim]Bungeling emperor[/color]!

								[color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], have you had a chance to visit [color=special]Callistaska[/color] yet?  The evil [color=dim]Kenny[/color] is still profiting from those infernal [color=special]bomb vending machines[/color], which only further adds to his capital and allows him to continue installing more and more [color=special]bomb vending machines[/color].

Please get rid of him, then stop back to see me.  I want to reward whomever takes that guy out with a very [color=special]special item[/color]!

							<comment>Last I heard, [color=dim]Kenny[/color] was selling merchandise over in [color=special]Callistaska[/color], just a little bit to the [color=special]southwest[/color] of here.  Take him out if you can, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!</comment>

							<comment>I think you can find [color=special]Callistaska[/color] just a little ways [color=special]southwest[/color] of here, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  We need to get rid of [color=dim]Kenny[/color] for good!</comment>

							<comment>If you have any trouble making it down to [color=special]Callistaska[/color] on your way to get rid of [color=special]Kenny[/color], you should consider customizing your controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color].  If you don&apos;t want to do that, though, the default [color=special]@bomb[/color] will work perfectly fine for dropping a bomb on him!</comment>

							<comment>If you hold down the [color=special]@left[/color] key to keep moving toward the west, you will eventually enter the town of [color=special]Callistaska[/color].  Once you get there, you should take care of [color=special]Kenny[/color] to stop him from making any more money with his [color=dim]bomb vending machines[/color]!</comment>

							<comment>You bought the contract, huh, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?  I&apos;m glad to hear that, but I fear [color=dim]Kenny[/color] still has a lot of resources at his disposal.  I&apos;d hate to see him start another business venture of a similar kind!</comment>

								I just got word about what you did to [color=dim]Kenny[/color].  You cannot overestimate how much this means to me, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!

As I promised, I have a [color=special]special item[/color] for you.  I chose it at random from my best selection, and I think you'll really like it.  Put it to good use, and try to save us all from the [color=dim]Bungeling emperor[/color]!

What incredible selflessness!  Now that you have purified [color=special]Lelandria[/color] of its most sinister businessman, you should consider customizing your controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color]!</comment>

								A great number of would-be heroes have previously attempted to eliminate [color=special]Kenny[/color] for me.  All of them failed because all of them entered battle using the default gameplay controls.

Where they failed, though, you succeeded!  Your specially-configured controls allowed you to surprise [color=special]Kenny[/color].  Now you can turn your focus to the remainder of the [color=dim]bad guys[/color], and you will undoubtedly defeat them just as easily!
