                [l id = 'line1'] Hi, $player$!  I've been waiting for you to make it this far.  My highness, the $High Empress of Lelandria$, posted me in this area to warn \
                    you about the latest threat from the ^Bungeling Empire^.
                    -redirect root

                [n id = 'nag1'] You probably have some past experience with these guys, but in case you need a refresher or want to know a little more, you can ask me anything!

                    +faq Tell me about the bad guys.  How do they behave?

                        >>> root.faq

                            [n id = 'nag1'] All of the bad guys behave exactly the same way:  they will chase you down and try to kill you!  Keep a safe distance from them at all times.  If they touch you, you'll be history!

                    +defense Can I fight back against the bad guys?

                        >>> root.defense

                            [n id = 'nag1'] You can't attack the bad guys directly.  Using your $mining laser$, though, you can dig traps in the ground for the bad guys to fall in.

                                If a bad guy falls into a trap, you can safely run over his head.  Take care, though, as the bad guys won't stay stuck in the trap for very long!

                    +details I'd like to ask more specific questions than these...

                        >>> root.details

                            [n id = 'nag1' class = 'free-item'] Ask me anything you'd like to know, $player$.  After you've finished quizzing me about the ^bad guys^, I'll give you a cool $item$ to help you \
                                on your way.

                                +gold Do the enemies collect gold?

                                    >>> root.details.gold

                                        [n id = 'nag1'] They do!  If an enemy touches a piece of gold, he will hold onto it indefinitely.

                                            When an enemy is carrying a piece of gold, you will notice that he changes color.  If you can manage to trap one of these gold-carrying \
                                            bad guys in the ground with your mining laser, he will drop the piece of gold that he is carrying.

                                        [n id = 'nag1'] Unfortunately, the sinister ^Bungeling Emperor^ has a virtually endless supply of henchmen at his disposal.  Although you can gain a temporary reprieve from danger \
                                            by destroying an enemy, a replacement will quickly respawn into the game to take his place.

                [l id = 'line1'] As you play through the game, $player$, you'll find a lot of interesting $items$.  Each $item$ will affect you in different ways.  For example, one item might increase your running speed, \
                    and another item might slow down the enemies.  Useful, huh?!

                    You'll find a lot more people in $Lelandria$ that have $items$ for you, $player$.  A lot of people will ask you to do little favors for them.  Other people work as $merchants$, selling you their \
                    items outright for a price.

                [l id = 'line2' class = 'prompt'] I want to let you choose which item you'd like to have, $player$.  I have a ton of introductory items available, but I'll just select a couple of them at random and let you choose.  You'll \
                    be finding a lot better items than my simple trinkets soon, $player$, so don't worry too much about which one sounds better!

                    Also, don't forget to experiment with upgrading the item too.  I gave you a very rudimentary offering, but you might find it more useful than you'd \
                    expect if you purchase an upgrade that suits your playstyle!

                [l id = 'line1' class = 'controls-uncustomized'] Welcome to $Lelandria$, $player$.  Why haven't you tried to $customize your controls$ yet, if you don't mind \
                    me asking?  You can do it right now in the $pause menu$!

                [l id = 'line2' class = 'controls-uncustomized'] Don't you want to unlock the achievement for customizing your controls, $player$?  You only have to edit one of them!

                [l id = 'line3' class = 'controls-uncustomized'] You continue to insist on using the default controls, $player$?  I understand.  You want one of us to give you a good reason \
                    to spend the time in your $pause menu$ updating your controls.

                    Yes, I will give you these $10 gold pieces$ I have been saving just for this occasion!

                [l id = 'line4' class = 'controls-uncustomized'] Please, $player$!  I had to risk my life to recover those gold pieces from the ^bad guys^!  For that, you could surely \
                    take the time to update your controls in the $pause menu$, couldn't you?  The very future of $Lelandria$ hangs in the balance!

                [n id = 'nag1' class = 'controls-uncustomized'] The ^Bungeling Emperor^ subjects all of his troops to a rigorous set of training exercises that focus on the power of \
                    $customizing controls$.  Only after each ^bad guy^ has learned that power can they enlist in his terrible army and begin tormenting our beautiful land!

                [n id = 'nag2' class = 'controls-uncustomized'] You still haven't customized your controls yet, have you, $player$?  I wish I had paid more attention in school on the day they talked about how to $customize controls$.  \
                    I didn't, though, and now I don't know how to move to the $right$ at all!

                [n id = 'nag3' class = 'controls-customized'] I see you spent a little time customizing your control settings, $player$.  What did you decide to set the $bomb$ key to?  $@bomb$, huh?  I should \
                    have thought of that myself!

                [n id = 'nag4' class = 'controls-customized'] Everyone is talking about the great work you're doing, $player$.  All of the other ^heroes^ that have arrived here have ultimately failed, but all of my \
                    friends agree that $you$ will succeed!

                    We also agree that the time you took to $customize your controls$ will make all the difference in this fight against the ^Bungeling empire^.
