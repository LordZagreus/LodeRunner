                [n id = 'nag1' class = 'default'] Greetings, $player$!  I have a few little trinkets to help you defeat the ^Bungeling Emperor^.

                    +shop I'd like to do some shopping.

                            [l id = 'line1' class = 'available'] On the record, $player$?  No.  Perhaps, though...

                                I've been quabbling with another merchant lately.  I don't want to name them yet, but I could do a lot more business \
                                if you paid them a visit with one of my bombs.

                                +more Please, give me a name...

                                +later I've got to go.

                            [n id = 'nag1' class = 'available'] If you're still looking for some better wares, then you're going to have to play ball.

                                I'm still quabbling with that other unnamed merchant.  I could do a lot more business if you knocked them out of the park.

                                +more Okay, give me a name...

                                    >>> root.quest.more

                                        [l id = 'line1'] Look for a merchant named $Nichole$ just northwest of here, in $Edenton$.  She's been siphoning off a lot of my clients lately.

                                            With all of the ^bad guys^ controlling the rural areas of $Lelandria$, I can't risk confronting her directly.

                                            You, on the other hand...

                                        [l id = 'line2'] If you dispose of $Nichole$, I'll upgrade my inventory and regain all of my old customers at the same \
                                            time.

                                            What do you say, $player$?

                                            +accept[class = 'default'] I'll do it, don't worry.

                                                        I think I'll just hold on to them.  Now, get to work!

                                                        Don't forget to take a look at my inventory, also.  I added my $rare items$ for your perusal!

                            [n id = 'nag2' class = 'failed'] I tried to work with you, $player$, but you wouldn't play ball.  I'm not going to waste my time \
                                giving you another task!

                            [n id = 'nag3' class = 'failed'] If you're looking for something different, maybe you should check with $Nichole$.  You like her better than you like me, right?

                [n id = 'nag3' class = 'quest:in-progress'] Next time you're in $Edenton$, remember to take care of $Nichole$ for me.  I'll make it worth your while, $player$!

                [n id = 'nag5' class = 'quest:failed'] Too bad you went back on your word, $player$.  I'll still sell to you, though!

                [l id = 'line1' transition = '1'] Thank you for taking care of $Nichole$ for me.  I had heard rumors of a private gold stash she kept, but I clearly \
                    won't have a chance to quiz her about it now.  Make sure to take a fresh look at my inventory, $player$.  As we agreed, I've added my $rare items$ to the listing!

                    When you decided to warn $Nichole$, she began to transport her gold reserves to \
                    the southern reaches of $Lelandria$.  After you finished your job, I intercepted her personal courier, killed him, and made off with the gold she clearly wasn't needing any longer!

                [l id = 'line2' transition = '1'] I'll happily share $50 gold pieces$ of that great bounty with you in return, $player$!
