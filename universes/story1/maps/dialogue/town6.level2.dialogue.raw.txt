                [l id = 'line1'] Good day, $player$.  Have you had a chance to visit any of the $bomb vending machines$ yet?  I hear you can get some really good deals.

                [n id = 'nag1'] In the interest of full disclosure, $player$, I must tell you that I have no idea who's profiting from the $bomb vending machines$.

                [n id = 'nag2'] Ever since the ^Bungeling empire^ invaded our beautiful land, I've started making a lot of money.  I can't tell you how, though.

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I can't help but to notice that you haven't customized your controls yet, $player$.  You \
                    look like a new player, yes.  I like new players because I make a lot of gold off of them.

                    +oops[min-gold = '5'] I will give you these 5 gold pieces, $Kenny$.

                        >>> root.oops

                            [n id = 'nag1'] Thank you, $player$.  I always like players who immediately choose the first option, whether on accident or not!

                                @pre-script
                                    player().subtractGold(5);
                                -redirect trap

                    +ok Goodbye.

                        >>> root.ok

                            [n id = 'nag1'] 

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I notice you have already customized your controls in the $pause menu$.  Smart.  A smart player like you \
                    uses $bombs$ with great skill and aplomb.

                    You should definitely stop by one of my many $bomb vending machines$ to stock up!

            >>> trap

                [n id = 'nag1'] You never took the time to customize your controls, $player$.  Yes, you still look like a new player.  I make a lot of gold off of new players like you!

                    +oops[min-gold = '5'] I will give you these 5 gold pieces again, $Kenny$.

                        >>> root.oops

                            [n id = 'nag1'] Thanks again, $player$!  This will never get old!

                                @pre-script
                                    player().subtractGold(5);

                    +ok I should stop giving you gold immediately.  You will never give me anything in return, and eventually I will simply run out of gold.  Goodbye, ^Kenny^.

                [n id = 'nag1'] Yes, I'm making a lot of money selling bombs to both $you$ and the ^bad guys^, and I hope to make a lot more!  If you want to \
                    buy some bombs, please visit one of my many $vending machines$.  Otherwise, please leave me to count my money in peace.

                    +buy[min-gold = '100'] I'd like to buy your business contract, ^Kenny^.

                        >>> root.buy

                            [n id = 'nag1'] You're offering me a lot of $gold$ there, $player$.  I usually wouldn't listen to an offer like this, but you obviously mean business.

                                I think I can agree to your offer.  Are you sure you want to buy my business contracts?

                                +confirm Yes, I'm sure.  Give me the contracts.

                                    >>> root.buy.confirm

                                        [l id = 'line1'] Ok, $player$!  Now that we have finalized the sale, why don't you take a moment to make your first business decision?

                                            If you'd like, I can deposit $all of the bomb vending machine revenue$ into your gold reserves, netting you $250 gold pieces$ this \
                                            very minute.  Alternatively, you could decide to $lower the prices$ on each machine, saving you and everyone else a little money on each purchase.

                                            Make the call, business owner!

                                            +withdraw I'm going to withdraw the money, ^Kenny^.

                                                >>> root.buy.confirm.withdraw

                                                    [l id = 'line1'] You are going to do a great job with these machines, $player$.  As you requested, I have deposited all of the revenue into your account, \
                                                        netting you a cool $250 gold pieces$.  Have a nice day!

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] I'm still trying to put together a new business venture, now that I'm not bringing in all of that money from the $bomb vending machines$ you bought from me.

                [n id = 'nag2'] Looking back, I wish I hadn't sold you my business contracts, $player$.  I sure did make a lot of money from those $bomb vending machines$!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I can't believe that someone who hasn't even customized their controls in the $pause menu$ now owns \
                    all of the $bomb vending machines$.  You impress me, $player$!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] You did a nice job of customizing your gameplay controls, but you won't need to adjust a thing on the \
                    $bomb vending machines$ I sold you.  I programmed them to perfection, thanks to my use of the $Python$ programming language!

                [l id = 'line1'] I used to know this guy in a little town just east of here.  I think people called him $Alien$.  I only remember him because he constantly \
                    whined about how much money I made from my $bomb vending machines$.

                [n id = 'nag1'] I haven't seen that guy in a pretty long time, $player$.  I bet someone got tired of his whining.

                [n id = 'nag2' class = 'once'] I feel really charitable today, knowing that people like $Alien$ can't stop me from making money anymore. \
                    Just to flaunt, I'm going to give you $35 gold pieces$ for absolutely nothing!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I'd like to see you customize your controls in the $pause menu$ soon.  If you change your controls, \
                    you might accidentally waste some $bombs$ as you adjust to the new settings.  When you run out of $bombs$, you will eventually need to buy more at one of my $bomb vending machines$, and I \
                    will profit!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] How many $bombs$ do you have left?  $$[core.bombs.count]$, I see.  You must have done a great job \
                    customizing your controls to have that many left.
