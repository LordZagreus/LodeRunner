                                    in the direction your character is currently facing.
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line2'] You might notice that you cannot dig directly beneath a ^ladder^.  Aside from that limitation, you can dig ^wherever^ you want, ^whenever^ you want.  You will never run out of "ammo!"
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line3'] Remember that you can return to previous levels at any time.
