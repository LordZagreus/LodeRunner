												You can't attack the bad guys directly.  Using your [color=special]mining laser[/color], though, you can dig traps in the ground for the bad guys to fall in.

If a bad guy falls into a trap, you can safely run over his head.  Take care, though, as the bad guys won't stay stuck in the trap for very long!

																They do!  If an enemy touches a piece of gold, he will hold onto it indefinitely.

When an enemy is carrying a piece of gold, you will notice that he changes color.  If you can manage to trap one of these gold-carrying bad guys in the ground with your mining laser, he will drop the piece of gold that he is carrying.

								As you play through the game, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], you'll find a lot of interesting [color=special]items[/color].  Each [color=special]item[/color] will affect you in different ways.  For example, one item might increase your running speed, and another item might slow down the enemies.  Useful, huh?!

You'll find a lot more people in [color=special]Lelandria[/color] that have [color=special]items[/color] for you, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  A lot of people will ask you to do little favors for them.  Other people work as [color=special]merchants[/color], selling you their items outright for a price.

You&apos;ll be finding a lot better items than my simple trinkets soon, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], so don&apos;t worry too much about which one sounds better!</comment>

								I just deposited the item you requested into your inventory, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  Make sure to view your inventory in the [color=special]pause menu[/color] to analyze how your new item works, and then equip it for use!

Also, don't forget to experiment with upgrading the item too.  I gave you a very rudimentary offering, but you might find it more useful than you'd expect if you purchase an upgrade that suits your playstyle!

								You continue to insist on using the default controls, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?  I understand.  You want one of us to give you a good reason to spend the time in your [color=special]pause menu[/color] updating your controls.

								Everyone is talking about the great work you're doing, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  All of the other [color=dim]heroes[/color] that have arrived here have ultimately failed, but all of my friends agree that [color=special]you[/color] will succeed!

																Travel a little bit farther to the east to reach the small town of [color=special]Smithsville[/color].

You should look for [color=special]town areas[/color] when you need a moment to escape from the [color=dim]bad guys[/color].  Although you will encounter endless waves of [color=dim]bad guys[/color] in the wild, each town remains [color=special]safe[/color] from the hostile invaders.

You can use the gold you collect during your adventure to purchase items from the [color=special]merchants[/color].

You might find some other uses for your gold inventory, too!
