								I notice you have already customized your controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color].  Smart.  A smart player like you uses [color=special]bombs[/color] with great skill and aplomb.

You should definitely stop by one of my many [color=special]bomb vending machines[/color] to stock up!

												You're offering me a lot of [color=special]gold[/color] there, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I usually wouldn't listen to an offer like this, but you obviously mean business.

I think I can agree to your offer.  Are you sure you want to buy my business contracts?

																Ok, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  Now that we have finalized the sale, why don't you take a moment to make your first business decision?

If you'd like, I can deposit [color=special]all of the bomb vending machine revenue[/color] into your gold reserves, netting you [color=special]250 gold pieces[/color] this very minute.  Alternatively, you could decide to [color=special]lower the prices[/color] on each machine, saving you and everyone else a little money on each purchase.

Make the call, business owner!
