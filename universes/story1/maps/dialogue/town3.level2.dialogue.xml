							<comment>Hi, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I&apos;m expecting some sort of delivery from a friend of mine in [color=special]Amandria[/color].  If you run across [color=special]Dave[/color], please ask him if he has a spare [color=special]item[/color] to send to me!</comment>

							<comment>Hey [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], have you seen any delivery worker recently, perhaps around [color=special]Amandria[/color]?  A friend of mine named [color=special]Dave[/color] said he planned to send me a [color=special]special item[/color], but I haven&apos;t seen anything show up yet.</comment>

							<comment>If you can&apos;t remember how to get to [color=special]Amandria[/color], you can take a look at the world map in your [color=special]pause menu[/color].  While you&apos;re there, you can also choose to customize your gameplay controls!</comment>

							<comment>I wish I could customize my default walking route as easily as you customized your controls, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  Unfortunately I cannot, and I must therefore rely upon [color=special]you[/color] to deliver the package from [color=special]Dave[/color].  Have you talked to him lately?</comment>

								Did [color=special]Dave[/color] send that item for me, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?

Wow, I can't believe it!  $[1.1.npc1.quest:item-title]!  This will surely help to keep me safe from the [color=dim]bad guys[/color], with enough practice and training!  Can I have it now, please?

												[color=special]Dave[/color] probably wouldn't approve of this arrangement.  We can keep it as our little secret, though!  I have to admit, I like gold even more than I like special items.

You've got a deal, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  You can keep the item, and I will take your [color=special]gold pieces[/color].  Maybe I can buy a better item with them!  Good luck against the [color=dim]bad guys[/color]!

							<comment>You&apos;re doing everything right so far, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  You brought me this item that will protect me from the terrible [color=dim]bad guys[/color], and you also took the time to customize your controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color]!</comment>

							<comment>I&apos;m thinking of investing this gold you gave me to help a new friend I met on the internet settle a Nigerian legal battle.  In the end, I&apos;ll have twice as much gold as you gave me originally, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!</comment>

							<comment>How long did it take you to customize your controls, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?  I have a friend who is trying to do that, but he just can&apos;t make it work!</comment>
