								Do you have a moment to take a brief quiz, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?

The quiz covers a variety of [color=special]classic videogames[/color].  If you can answer 3 questions in a row correctly, I will give you [color=special]1 skill point[/color] as a reward. I do hope you enjoy this quiz.

However, you only have one chance to complete the quiz, and you must notch a perfect score to win.  If you incorrectly answer any question, then you will fail the quiz!

								Get ready for the first question, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!

In the classic [color=special]Deus Ex[/color], a character named [color=special]Gunther Hermann[/color] attempted to operate a soda machine.  To his dismay, the vending machine malfunctioned and delivered him a [color=dim]lemon lime soda[/color].

Which flavor button did Gunther actually press?

								Well played, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  Let's move on to the next question.

In [color=special]Super Mario 64[/color], one of Mario's longtime enemies returned to serve as the game's [color=special]camera operator[/color].  Which previous enemy decided to enter this new, neutral role?

								Another fine selection, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  One last question stands between you and [color=special]1 skill point[/color]:

Many [color=special]Lode Runner[/color] games have appeared for PCs and other systems.  One of the following titles, though, does not actually exist.

Which of these titles [color=special]does not exist[/color]?

								Well done, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  You aced the quiz on your first try, most likely without loading from the checkpoint even once!  Congratulations!

As I promised, I will now present you with [color=special]1 skill point[/color].  Use it wisely!

								I'm sorry, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], but you did not select the correct answer to that question.

I cannot in good conscience let you walk home with empty hands, though.  As a consolation prize, please enjoy this [color=special]1 free bomb[/color].

Remember, if you blow me up with that bomb, you still won't get that skill point!

								You really know how to get what you want, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!

To be perfectly honest, I can respect your decision.  A lot of players would have used a search engine to find the right answers, but you decided to spend hard-earned gold pieces.

								In recognition of your honor,  I'm going to throw in [color=special]20 free bombs[/color] in addition to the [color=special]1 skill point[/color].

Good luck against the [color=dim]Bungeling empire[/color]!

							<comment>You know a great deal about videogames, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  Just in case you didn&apos;t know this already, though, let me remind you that you can customize your gameplay controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color] at any time!</comment>

							<comment>I don&apos;t know exactly how you have customized your controls, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], but I think everyone should download a copy of your configuration file to use in their own game.  You&apos;ve demonstrated such a thorough knowledge of videogames that I wouldn&apos;t want anyone else&apos;s!</comment>

							<comment>Don&apos;t worry too much about missing out on that skill point, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  You can easily earn more by completing other quests and by completing levels in the game!

							<comment>I feel pretty bad about not giving you that skill point, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I see that you customized your controls, which means you know a little bit more about this game than the average hero.  I think that means that you will find a way to overcome the loss of that skill point!</comment>
