								Hey, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  I heard about what you did to [color=special]Biggins[/color]!  I promised you more gold if you took care of him, and I always make good on my promises.

Please enjoy this [color=special]1 gold piece[/color]!

								[color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], do you have a spare [color=special]skill point[/color] to share with me?

If I can simply augment myself a little more, I might find the strength to leap across that gorge and make my way to a better place.  I need the [color=special]skill point[/color] first, though.  Can you help me out, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?

												I knew that I could convince you to give me a skill point.  This new neural persuasion augmentation is working exactly as I expected!

You can leave me now, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  Thanks to this incredibly powerful augmentation, I installed a special command in your subconscious mind to prevent you from harming me!
