								No one around here has any respect, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].

You've seen it for yourself!  Most people are just using you to distract themselves from the pathetic emptiness of their meaningless, consumer-driven lives!

[color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], I want you to put an end to all of that.

							<comment>[color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], I&apos;ve been tracking your progress.  I see that you&apos;ve killed $[npc.count.dead] out of $[npc.count.total] possible talking people in this game, including me in those numbers.  Keep trying!</comment>

							<comment>You&apos;ve killed $[npc.count.dead] of the people in [color=special]Lelandria[/color], and you haven&apos;t even paused to customize your controls.  That would only slow you down, but a surprising number of players do it anyway!</comment>

							<comment>Don&apos;t waste time talking to me, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  You have $[npc.count.living] more people in [color=special]Lelandria[/color] to kill.  Put that [color=special]@bomb[/color] control to work!</comment>

								You did a lot of work for me, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  You did a lot of good work.

First, let me offer you these [color=special]2 skill points[/color].  You definitely earned them.  I'd also like to give you [color=special]50 free bombs[/color].  You've proven beyond any doubt your ability to use them appropriately.

							<comment>Just for a moment, I had second thoughts about asking you to get rid of me.  When I noticed that you never took the time to customize your gameplay controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color], though... I don&apos;t want any part of a game with a player like that, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  Please, finish me!</comment>
