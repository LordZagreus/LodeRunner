                [l id = 'line1'] Thanks for visiting us here in $Navarra$, $player$.  I bet you've noticed a lot of the danger and violence in $Lelandria$.  The ^Bungeling empire^ is threatening every mile of our beautiful country.

                    Not too long ago, we all lived peacefully, in harmony.  Everything feels so different now, though.  I wish the ^bad guys^ would leave.
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line2'] Something else bothers me even more, though, $player$.

                    A merchant $somewhere to the west$ decided to install a series of $bomb vending machines$ in numerous \
                    locations.  You probably have seen some of them already.  Maybe you even bought some bombs from them, $player$.

                    The guy who installed the machines -- a guy named ^Kenny^ -- is deviously profiting from the violence in our once-quiet land.  Instead of \
                    trying to negotiate with the ^Bungeling empire^, we are selling bombs!
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line3' class = 'prompt'] If you happen to visit $Callistaska$ in your travels, find ^Kenny^.  Find him and destroy him!  I know it won't \
                    stop people from using his $bomb vending machines$, but at least no one will profit from them.

                    If you do get rid of him, stop back to see me.  I want to reward whomever takes that guy out with a very $special item$.

                    +yes[class = 'default'] I'll see what I can do.

                        >>> root.yes

                            [l id = 'line1'] Thanks, $player$!  Once you have gotten rid of ^Kenny^, stop back by and I'll give you that $special item$ I talked about.

                    +idea[class = 'default'] I have a better idea.  Give me $50 gold pieces$ and I'll buy him out of business.

                        >>> root.idea

                            [l id = 'line1'] Do you think that would work, $player$?  You'd still profit from the vending machines yourself after buying his contracts, and \
                                I don't know if I'd like that any better.  However, I do suppose you need all of the $gold$ you can get to save us from the ^Bungeling emperor^.

                                Here, $player$.  Take these $50 gold pieces$ and see what you can do.  Honestly, I really want you to get rid of ^Kenny^, whatever you end up \
                                doing.  I'll have that $special item$ waiting for you if you do it.

                    +done[class = 'complete'] That guy?  I already took him out.

                        >>> root.done

                            [l id = 'line1'] You did a great job, $player$.  I didn't even realize you had gotten rid of him already!

                                As a reward, I have a $special item$ for you.  I chose it at random from my best selection, and I think you'll really \
                                like it.  Put it to good use, and try to save us all from the ^Bungeling emperor^!

                            [n id = 'nag1'] Stop back by if you want to discuss this matter further, $player$.

                            [n id = 'nag2'] Give me a shout when you're ready to talk about this again, $player$.

                [n id = 'nag1' class = 'prompt'] $player$, have you had a chance to visit $Callistaska$ yet?  The evil ^Kenny^ is still profiting from those infernal $bomb vending machines$, which only \
                    further adds to his capital and allows him to continue installing more and more $bomb vending machines$.

                    Please get rid of him, then stop back to see me.  I want to reward whomever takes that guy out with a very $special item$!

                    +yes[class = 'default'] I'll see what I can do.

        @conversation[id = 'quest:in-progress']

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] Last I heard, ^Kenny^ was selling merchandise over in $Callistaska$, just a little bit to the $southwest$ of here.  Take him out if you can, $player$!

                [n id = 'nag2'] I think you can find $Callistaska$ just a little ways $southwest$ of here, $player$.  We need to get rid of ^Kenny^ for good!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] If you have any trouble making it down to $Callistaska$ on your way to get rid of $Kenny$, you should consider \
                    customizing your controls in the $pause menu$.  If you don't want to do that, though, the default $@bomb$ will work perfectly fine for dropping a bomb on him!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] If you hold down the $@left$ key to keep moving toward the west, you will eventually enter the town of $Callistaska$.  \
                    Once you get there, you should take care of $Kenny$ to stop him from making any more money with his ^bomb vending machines^!


        @conversation[id = 'quest:in-progress:bought-contract']

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1' class = 'default'] You bought the contract, huh, $player$?  I'm glad to hear that, but I fear ^Kenny^ still has a lot of resources at his disposal.  I'd \
                    hate to see him start another business venture of a similar kind!

                [n id = 'nag2' class = 'default'] ^Kenny^ won't have enough money to start another business soon, but one day he might amass another great wealth.  You should think about \
                    going back and finishing the job!

                [n id = 'nag3' class = 'lowered-prices'] I hear you lowered the prices at the $bomb vending machines$ after buying the contract, $player$.  I don't know if I would have done \
                    that.  Have you thought about getting rid of ^Kenny^ just to be safe?

                [n id = 'nag4' class = 'lowered-prices'] More people will want to buy bombs now that you've lowered the prices, $player$.  I don't know if you did the right thing. \
                    Have you thought about getting rid of ^Kenny^ as a way of compensating for your mistake?


        @conversation[id = 'quest:in-progress:killed-kenny']

            >>> root

                [l id = 'line1'] I just got word about what you did to ^Kenny^.  You cannot overestimate how much this means to me, $player$!

                    As I promised, I have a $special item$ for you.  I chose it at random from my best selection, and I think you'll really \
                    like it.  Put it to good use, and try to save us all from the ^Bungeling emperor^!

        @conversation[id = 'quest:complete']

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] You did everyone in $Lelandria$ a great service, $player$.  I'm glad that guy isn't polluting our land with black capitalism anymore!

                [n id = 'nag2'] Now that you've gotten rid of that evil ^Kenny^, we can finally start thinking about shutting down those $bomb vending machines$ of his.  Thanks again, $player$!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] You didn't even wait to customize your controls before getting rid of $Kenny$, did you, $player$?  What incredible \
                    selflessness!  Now that you have purified $Lelandria$ of its most sinister businessman, you should consider customizing your controls in the $pause menu$!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] A great number of would-be heroes have previously attempted to eliminate $Kenny$ for me.  All of them failed because all of \
                    them entered battle using the default gameplay controls.

                    Where they failed, though, you succeeded!  Your specially-configured controls allowed you to surprise $Kenny$.  Now you can turn your focus to the remainder of the ^bad guys^, and you will undoubtedly \
                    defeat them just as easily!
