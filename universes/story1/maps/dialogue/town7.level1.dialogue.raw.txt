                [l id = 'line1' class = 'thanks'] I hear you took care of $Linus$ for me, $player$.  Great job!

                    As we previously agreed, I have stocked some cheaper items \
                    for you to choose from.

                    In addition, if I ever need to ruthlessly eliminate another competitor, I will know exactly whom to call!  Ha ha ha!

                [n id = 'nag1' class = 'shop'] Finally, another customer!  Buy something, will ya?

                    +shop I want to buy some overpriced items.

                            [l id = 'line1'] Have you talked to $Linus$ on the other side of town, $player$?  His business is thriving, for reasons unknown to me!  I have repeatedly increased my prices in a \
                                desperate attempt to make my products look desirable, but it isn't working.

                            [n id = 'nag1' class = 'prompt'] Listen, $player$.  I don't like to engage in shady business practices, but I have no choice.  If you can get rid of $Linus$ for me, I will find some cheaper items for you.

                                +accept[class = 'default'] I'll put it on my todo list.

                                    >>> root.quest.accept

                                        [l id = 'line1'] A wise decision, $player$!  Check back in when you've taken care of business for me.

                [l id = 'line1' class = 'thanks'] Hi, $player$, do you have a minute?

                    I couldn't help but overhear the conversation where $William$ asked you to stamp me out.  Of course, I also saw what you did to him afterward. \
                    Personally, I would never ask you to preemptively reformat him instead, but I very much appreciate what you did.

                [n id = 'nag1' class = 'shop'] Good day, $player$.  I hope you find my inventory worthwhile!

                            [l id = 'line1'] Thanks for the donation, $player$!  If I can rummage together about $100 more gold pieces$, I can recompile my inventory system to include better items!
