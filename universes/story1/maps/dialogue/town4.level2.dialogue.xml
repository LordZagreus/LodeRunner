								You have proven yourself a very capable gold collector, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  For that reason, I think you can help me collect a payment.

On a recent visit to the far western edge of [color=special]Lelandria[/color], I loaned a precious family heirloom to a friend of mine named [color=special]Jessie[/color].

At the time, she promised to return it within a few days.  She made that promise over a year ago!

								I've tried everything I know, but I haven't found a way to get my [color=special]heirloom[/color] back from [color=special]Jessie[/color]!  You can't convince her directly, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  She will steadfastly resist any attempt at coercion or bribery.

I do have an idea, though...

								[color=special]Jessie[/color] has a good friend named [color=special]Amelia[/color] somewhere near where she lives, maybe a level away?  If you strike down [color=special]Amelia[/color] as a warning of sorts, I think [color=special]Jessie[/color] will finally get the message and cough up that [color=special]heirloom[/color].

I know you'll have to get your hands dirty on this one, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  If you don't feel comfortable doing this, I'll understand.  However, I have a [color=special]pair of special items[/color] that I will give to you if you can get that [color=special]heirloom[/color] back for me!

Do you understand, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?

								I didn't tell you to kill [color=special]Jessie[/color], I told you to get the [color=special]heirloom[/color] from her.  I'll never get it back now, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!

I'll give you [color=special]50 gold pieces[/color] for your effort, because you did ensure that she'll never steal another family heirloom.  However, I can't offer you anything more substantial than that without my now-lost family heirloom.  Thanks for trying...
