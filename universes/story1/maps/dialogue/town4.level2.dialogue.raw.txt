                [l id = 'line1'] You have proven yourself a very capable gold collector, $player$.  For that reason, I think you can help me collect a payment.

                    On a recent visit to the far western edge of $Lelandria$, I loaned a precious family heirloom to a friend of mine named $Jessie$.

                    At the time, she promised to return it within a few days.  She made that promise over a year ago!
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line2'] I've tried everything I know, but I haven't found a way to get my $heirloom$ back from $Jessie$!  You can't convince her directly, $player$.  She will steadfastly resist any attempt at coercion or bribery.

                    I do have an idea, though...
                    -redirect root

                [n id = 'nag1' class = 'prompt'] $Jessie$ has a good friend named $Amelia$ somewhere near where she lives, maybe a level away?  If you strike down $Amelia$ as a warning of sorts, I think $Jessie$ will finally get the message and cough up that $heirloom$.

                    I know you'll have to get your hands dirty on this one, $player$.  If you don't feel comfortable doing this, I'll understand.  However, I have a $pair of special items$ that I will give to you if you can get that $heirloom$ back for me!

                    Do you understand, $player$?

                    +sorry[class = 'sorry'] I have bad news.  I already killed $Jessie$.

                        >>> root.sorry

                            [l id = 'line1'] I guess you couldn't have known, $player$.  I'll give you $50 gold pieces$ for your premature vengeance, but I'll never get my $heirloom$ back now.

                            [l id = 'line1'] Good luck, $player$!

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] You'll have to visit the far western edge of $Lelandria$ to find my $heirloom$.  You know what you have to do.

                [n id = 'nag2'] If you take $Amelia$ out of the picture, then $Jessie$ will surely give the $heirloom$ to you.  I know she's somewhere in $Manderkeen$, far on the western edge of our land!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Maybe you can assassinate $Amelia$ in a gentle manner, $player$.  Instead of using the default $@bomb$ to \
                    blast her to pieces, you might think about using $@dig-left$  or $@dig-right$ to gently dig the ground in front of her?

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I wish we didn't have to involve $Amelia$ in this affair, $player$.  You remember when you customized your controls, \
                    though, don't you?  Sometimes you have to change things to get the results you want.

                [n id = 'nag1'] I didn't tell you to kill $Jessie$, I told you to get the $heirloom$ from her.  I'll never get it back now, $player$!

                    I'll give you $50 gold pieces$ for your effort, because you did ensure that she'll never steal another family heirloom.  However, I can't \
                    offer you anything more substantial than that without my now-lost family heirloom.  Thanks for trying...

                [l id = 'line1'] I know you had to do some bad things to get that $heirloom$ back, $player$.  I can't overstate my appreciation at this point!  Please, let me know how you'd like me to repay you for your effort, $player$!

                    +items I'd like those $2 special items$ you were talking about.

                            [l id = 'line1'] Absolutely, $player$!  I've been holding on to these for quite a while.  I'm sure they'll help you greatly in your quest against the ^Bungeling empire^!

                    +gold I'd like a large pile of gold instead.  $500 gold$ sounds about right.

                            [l id = 'line1'] I think you've earned that kind of a payday, $player$.  Take these $500 gold pieces$ and use them as you wish!

                            [l id = 'line1'] You've got it, $player$.  In addition to your normal $XP$ bonus for completing a quest, I'm adding in an extra $250 XP$.  Good luck against the ^Bungeling empire^!

                [n id = 'nag1'] How are you liking those $items$ I gave you, $player$?  I hope you're finding them useful!

                [n id = 'nag2'] I saved those $items$ for a hero like you, $player$.  Thanks for rescuing my $heirloom$!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Those items might work even better if you customize your controls in the $pause menu$!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I heard a rumor that you customized your controls already, $player$.  Do you know that you can customize items, too, by \
                    upgrading them?


        @conversation[id = 'quest:complete:took-gold']

            >>> root

                [n id = 'nag1'] You sure do like gold, $player$!  Don't let the ^bad guys^ find out you have so much!

                [n id = 'nag2'] Make sure to spend that ^gold^ I gave you with care, $player$!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] You sure do have a lot of gold for someone who hasn't even customized their controls in the $pause menu$, $player$!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] With your combination of vast gold reserves and finely customized controls, I expect you to embarrass the ^bad guys^ on your \
                    way to saving $Lelandria$ from the ^Bungeling empire^!

                [n id = 'nag1'] Did that extra $XP$ I gave you help you to level up, $player$?

                [n id = 'nag2'] I think you made the right call going for the $XP bonus$, just between you and me!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] While you're in the $pause menu$ spending your skill points, you can also choose to customize your gameplay controls!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I like how you decided to configure your controls, $player$.  Of course, I expected no less from you after you made the \
                    wise decision to request bonus XP!

                [n id = 'nag1'] I'll never see my precious $heirloom$ again.

                [n id = 'nag2'] I wish you could have recovered that $heirloom$ for me, $player$.

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] You should have customized your controls in the $pause menu$ before attempting my quest, $player$.  You might have had better results!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] What went wrong with the quest, $player$?  You configured your controls exactly how you wanted them.  What went wrong?!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] The ^Bungeling emperor^ no doubt has received intelligence reports about how well you have \
                    customized your controls, $player$.  At last, that terrible ^emperor^ will have a little fear of his own!
