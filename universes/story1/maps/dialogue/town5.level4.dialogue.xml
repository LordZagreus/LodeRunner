								Have you spent any time shopping with [color=special]Alice[/color] yet, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?  She does a good job, but I think I could do a better job.  I don't want to directly compete with her, though.  I wouldn't make enough money, so currently I'm not working as a [color=special]merchant[/color].

If she went out of business, though...

								Look, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I like [color=special]Alice[/color], and I don't want to see anything bad happen to her.  If you can, find a way to shut her down without hurting her.  Hopefully you don't have to send her packing!

Once you have taken care of things, I will eagerly show you how much better work I can do as a [color=special]merchant[/color]!

												I didn't want to see that happen, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  What reason did you have to do that to [color=special]Alice[/color], one of the nicest girls in town?  I thought you were going to fight against the [color=dim]Bungeling empire[/color], not alongside them!

Still, I will take this opportunity to start my own [color=special]merchant business[/color].  Given the circumstances, I don't feel like importing special items, but you should still appreciate the [color=special]items[/color] I'm carrying.  Please stop by anytime!

[color=special]Alice[/color] increased her sales by [color=special]200%[/color] when she customized her controls, and I bet I can do even better if I start up a shoppe of my own!</comment>

								Did you think I wouldn't see that, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?  I told you I didn't want anything bad to happen to [color=special]Alice[/color].  I guess I should have known better.

Still, I will take this opportunity to start my own [color=special]merchant business[/color].  Given the circumstances, I didn't have enough time to import special items, but you will still love the [color=special]items[/color] I'm carrying.  Please stop by anytime!

								Thanks for taking care of things with grace, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I do like [color=special]Alice[/color], and I'm glad she'll be staying around as a civilian.

Like I said before, I'm going to go ahead and start working as a [color=special]merchant[/color] now.  Knowing [color=special]Alice[/color] would be sticking around, I took the time to order some [color=special]extra special[/color] items that you will totally love!  Make sure to stop back to see what I have in stock!

												I have to admit, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], that I haven't been doing a lot of business lately.  My usual customers can't travel as freely with all of the [color=dim]bad guys[/color] running amok.  I wish I could refuse your offer, but I could really use that kind of money.

I think we have a deal, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  Thanks for the generous offer you made me.  Good luck against the [color=dim]Bungeling empire[/color]!
