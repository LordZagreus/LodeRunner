							<comment>I think she [color=dim]stole it[/color] from someone named [color=special]Erin[/color] over in [color=special]Navarra[/color].  I don&apos;t know for sure, though.  Maybe you should ask?</comment>

							<comment>I asked [color=special]Jessie[/color] if I could wear that [color=special]heirloom[/color] she allegedly stole.  However, she told me that I couldn&apos;t because I hadn&apos;t properly customized my controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color].</comment>

							<comment>Some time ago, I asked [color=special]Jessie[/color] if I could wear the [color=special]heirloom[/color] she purportedly stole from a woman east of here.  Unfortunately, she told me that I couldn&apos;t because she disapproved of the way I had customized my gameplay controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color]!</comment>
