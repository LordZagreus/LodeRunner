							<comment>Hi, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  I hope the [color=dim]bad guys[/color] aren&apos;t giving you too much trouble.  If you need help against them, you can buy some [color=special]new items[/color] from [color=special]Nichole[/color]!</comment>

							<comment>A lot of people buy [color=special]items[/color] from [color=special]Nichole[/color].  Just between you and me:  She keeps a pretty large stash of gold hidden in an unknown reserve.  Even I don&apos;t know where to find it!</comment>

						<line id = 'line3' class = 'nichole-alive'>
							<comment>One time, [color=special]Nichole[/color] told me that she would only take her gold out from the vault if she feared for her life.</comment>

						<line id = 'line4' class = 'nichole-dead'>
							<comment>I always warned [color=special]Nichole[/color] about the dangers of getting into the merchant business.  When the [color=dim]Bungeling empire[/color] showed up, I knew trouble would find her.</comment>

							<comment>I wish I had enough gold to buy some of [color=special]Nichole[/color]&apos;s items.  After you defeat the [color=dim]Bungeling empire[/color], maybe you&apos;ll share some with me!</comment>

							<comment>You&apos;re lucky that [color=special]Nichole[/color] allows you to look at her items, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  The last hero that stopped by without customizing their controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color]?  She turned him away!</comment>

							<comment>For some players, [color=special]Nichole[/color] used to sell detailed instructions on the best way to customize gameplay controls. She knows that she can&apos;t run that kind of scam on you, though.</comment>

							<comment>I&apos;m thinking of starting my own shoppe, now that [color=special]Nichole[/color] has disappeared.  I just need to save up a few million pieces of gold first!</comment>

							<comment>[color=special]Nichole[/color] always warned me about heroes, saying that they&apos;d just as soon blow you up as they would save you from anything.  I trust you though, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!</comment>

							<comment>I don&apos;t know what I will sell if I start my own shoppe, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  Would you have any interest in a video tutorial showing you how to customize your controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color]?</comment>

						<line priority = '-1' max-reads = '1' id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'nichole-dead controls-customized'>
							<comment>I wish I had the ability to customize my controls like you did, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  With better controls, I could have tried to save [color=special]Nichole[/color] from whoever killed her!</comment>

											<comment>I&apos;ve known [color=special]Curry[/color] for a long time.  I wish he hadn&apos;t stooped to that level, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  Thanks for the warning.  I think I owe you a small reward for your honesty.  Perhaps this [color=special]special item[/color] will help you against the [color=dim]Bungeling empire[/color] and other serpents like [color=dim]Curry[/color] the evil merchant.</comment>

												I appreciate that you meant well, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], but we already have enough violence in [color=special]Lelandria[/color].  If you had simply given me a heads up, I might have shared a special item with you, but I don't know if I can trust you anymore.

I suppose I owe you at least a small token of gratitude.  Please, take these [color=special]50 gold pieces[/color] with my regards.
