								Welcome to our humble town, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!  My name is [color=special]Rochelle[/color].  I would offer to show you around town, but we don't even have a single [color=special]merchant[/color] to buy things from!

I'd like to ask you a favor, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], but I don't feel like I know you well enough yet.  Maybe if we get to know each other a little bit better, I'll feel more comfortable...

								Thanks for taking such an interest in me, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I almost feel like I can trust you with anything.  All of these [color=dim]bad guys[/color] that are running around in the wild areas, though, scare me pretty bad!

I really appreciate having you around to talk to in times like this.  Maybe you can stop by again soon?  I want to ask you about that favor, but I'm still trying to find the words...

								[color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], I have to talk to you about something.  Have you talked to [color=special]Carlos[/color] up there?  I can't stop looking at him!

I don't feel confident enough to approach him yet, though.  If I had a nice [color=special]perfume[/color], I would feel much more at ease.

								Have you visited [color=special]Amandria[/color] yet?  If you go there, you should find a merchant that is selling my favorite perfume.

Do you think you can help me, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]?  I will surely reward you with a wonderful and useful item!

								You bought the perfume, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  I didn't know if you'd actually follow through on your word, not after you pilfered that extra gold from me when you took the job.

All the same, I bet [color=special]Carlos[/color] will absolutely love this perfume.  Can I have it now, please?!

												Thank you so much, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]!

I would have liked to repay you for your kindness, but I believe I already paid you pretty well.  I love this perfume, though, so I'm going to offer you this [color=special]not-so-special item[/color] as a token of my indifference.

Hopefully it can help you in your quest to extort gold out of everyone else in [color=special]Lelandria[/color].
