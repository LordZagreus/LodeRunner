                [l id = 'line1'] How did you find me down here, $player$?  Never mind that.  I have toiled in this place for too long.

                    It all started when I fell behind on payments to one of the $merchants$ around here.  When I couldn't make my payments, they banished me to this location.
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line2'] I've never managed to figure out how to reach that $switch$ up there, so I can't escape.  I don't care about escaping any more, though.

                    I want vengeance.  $player$, you must destroy every merchant you can find in all of $Lelandria$.  You must make them pay for my suffering!
                    -redirect root

                [l id = 'line3' class = 'prompt'] Will you help me, $player$?  Will you bomb every merchant in $Lelandria$ to hell?

                    +accept[class = 'default'] Absolutely.  It'll be my pleasure!

                        >>> root.accept

                            [l id = 'line1'] I can't wait, $player$.  Without the terrible corruption of merchandising in this land, everyone in $Lelandria$ will live a better life.  Except for the merchants themselves, naturally!

                            [n id = 'nag1'] Don't leave me here like this, $player$.  Come back if you change your mind!

                    +already-done[class = 'already-done'] I don't like merchants either, $Han$.  They're all gone already!

                [n id = 'nag1' class = 'prompt'] I need you to get revenge on the $merchants$ for banishing me to this level, $player$.  Will you bomb every merchant to hell for me now?

                    +accept[class = 'default'] Absolutely.  I'm going to get to work!

                    +later[class = 'default'] Not yet, $Han$.

                    +already-done[class = 'already-done'] I don't like merchants either, $Han$.  They're all gone already!

                [n id = 'nag1'] I see that you are still working on ridding $Lelandria$ of every last merchant.  Get rid of the $[merchant.count.living] remaining merchant(s), the one(s) who \
                    unjustly sentenced me to this cruel fate!  Check all the towns!  Check everywhere!  Please!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] If you customize your controls in the $pause menu$, you might kill the $[merchant.count.living] remaining \
                    merchant(s) more quickly.

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] If you see one of the $[merchant.count.living] remaining merchant(s), $player$, please use your \
                    $@bomb$ control liberally!

                [l id = 'line1'] You did it, $player$!  You exterminated every last $merchant$ from the entire game!  I can't put into words just how much that means to me!

                    I have a couple of $very special items$ to share with you.  I stole these from the merchants, and they didn't take kindly to that.  Thanks to you, I'll never owe a one of them one single cent!

                [n id = 'nag1'] I bet those bomb machines are doing great business now that you've wiped out every merchant in $Lelandria$.

                [n id = 'nag2'] I wish you could rescue me from this place, $player$.  Unfortunately, my predefined path will leave me trapped here forever.

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I can't customize my movement controls in the $pause menu$, and therefore I will remain on this level \
                    until the end of time.

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Thanks for using your specially-configured gameplay controls to get rid of all of the merchants in \
                    $Lelandria$.  I will never forget it!
