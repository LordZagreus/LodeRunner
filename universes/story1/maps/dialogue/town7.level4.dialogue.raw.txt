                [n id = 'nag1'] How's it going, $player$?

                [n id = 'nag2'] Are you looking for a merchant, $player$?  Stay away from that guy in $Callistaska$.  I don't like him!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] If you're looking for a place to customize your gameplay controls, make sure you don't look for \
                    it in $Callistaska$!  Try the $pause menu$ instead!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I hear that the merchants in $Callistaska$ charge an extra 500 gold pieces on every item they sell to players \
                    that have customized their controls.  You'd better stay away from there!

                [l id = 'line1'] Please don't kill me, $player$.  I have a lot of money.  Here, take these $15 gold pices$ and spare my life!

                    @post-script
                        quest("6.3.npc2.quest").update("update-jake-donated-gold").status("active");
                        player().addGold(15);

                [l id = 'line2'] Ok, look.  That guy $Biggins$ never liked me.  He blames all of his problems on me.  I never did anything to him.  To prove that I'm a nice guy, \
                    let me give you another $15 gold pieces$ for sparing my life.

                    @post-script
                        player().addGold(15);

                [l id = 'line3'] Maybe you should pixelize $Biggins$ instead of me, $player$.  I'm just making a suggestion.  Also, I'm just giving you these $15 gold pieces$ because \
                    I like helping people.  I could probably help you a lot more if I didn't have to worry about $Biggins$ down there in $Callistaska$.

                [n id = 'nag1'] Thanks for not killing me yet, $player$.  I appreciate it.

                [n id = 'nag2'] A lot of people would have used a bomb by now, $player$.  Thanks for your kindness!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Would you like me to help you customize your gameplay controls, $player$?  I'd be happy to \
                    help you in the $pause menu$!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] I want to give you a few more gold pieces, because I really respect the work you did \
                    customizing your gameplay controls!

            >>> root

                [l id = 'line1'] Hey, $player$!  I heard about what you did to $Biggins$!  I promised you more gold if you took care of him, and I always make good on my promises.

                    Please enjoy this $1 gold piece$!

                    @post-script
                        player().addGold(1);

                [l id = 'line2'] Okay, I understand your anger, $player$.  I will make this right, right now.  Please enjoy an additional $500 gold pieces$!

                    @post-script
                        player().addGold(500);

                        npc("npc1").clearIndicators();

                [n id = 'nag1'] What more do you want from me, $player$?  I've given you a very handsome reward for taking care of $Biggins$.

                [n id = 'nag2'] If you think I'm going to give you more gold, then you're wrong, $player$!  I gave you a bunch already!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] $Biggins$ probably didn't respect you either.  He always made fun of me for not customizing my controls in \
                    the $pause menu$.  You taught him a great lesson in respect!

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Do you know that $Biggins$ tried to add an excise tax to the $pause menu$?  Yeah!  He wanted to receive some kind \
                    of fee every time someone customized their controls.  Doesn't that sound awful?!

                [l id = 'line1'] $player$, do you have a spare $skill point$ to share with me?

                    If I can simply augment myself a little more, I might find the strength to leap across that gorge and make my way to a better place.  I need the $skill point$ first, \
                    though.  Can you help me out, $player$?

                    +yes[min-skill-points = '1'] Here, $JC$.  I can spare you $1 skill point$.

                        >>> root.yes

                            [l id = 'line1'] I knew that I could convince you to give me a skill point.  This new neural persuasion augmentation is working exactly as I expected!

                                You can leave me now, $player$.  Thanks to this incredibly powerful augmentation, I installed a special command in your subconscious mind to prevent you from harming me!

                        >>> root.no

                            [n id = 'nag1'] Please hurry, $player$.  I need that $skill point$ very desperately!

                [n id = 'nag1'] I still need a skill point to escape this place, $player$.  Can you spare a $skill point$ for me yet?

                    +yes[min-skill-points = '1'] Here, $JC$.  I can now spare you $1 skill point$.

                    +no I'll have to get back to you on that one.

                [n id = 'nag1'] You can't defeat me in verbal combat, $player$.  You should leave before I trick you out of another one of your skill points.

                [n id = 'nag2'] Remember when I tricked you into giving me one of your skill points, $player$?  Come back and see me sometime!

                [n id = 'nagUncustomized1' class = 'controls-uncustomized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] You haven't customized your gameplay controls in the $pause menu$ yet, I see.  You probably don't have \
                    any augmentations, either.

                [n id = 'nagCustomized1' class = 'controls-customized' priority = '-1' max-reads = '1'] Your customized gameplay controls will not help you against me, $player$.
