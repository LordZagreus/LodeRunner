							<comment>When I moved here, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], the [color=special]Empress of Lelandria[/color] promised me control of an important gate.  Do you see a gate around here?  I don&apos;t!</comment>

							<comment>The [color=special]Empress[/color] told me that the [color=special]gate[/color] would block access to "Act II," whatever that means!  In the end, she must have decided against closing off certain portions of the game world to people like you.</comment>

							<comment>Oh, right.  You are "saving" our gold for us, keeping it safe from those [color=dim]bad guys[/color].  I&apos;ve heard it all before, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color].  How about proving it by giving some of that gold back to the citizenry?</comment>

											<comment>You surprise me, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color], this one time.  I&apos;ve been holding onto these [color=special]10 bombs[/color] for long enough.  I want you to have them.</comment>

							<comment>If you go stand on top of one of these ladders for [color=special]82 minutes[/color] or longer without moving, I will give you [color=special]592 gold pieces[/color].  I&apos;m not making this up!</comment>

							<comment>Tell me which took longer, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]:  customizing your controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color] or deciding how to spend all of the [color=special]gold pieces[/color] you have been stealing from us?</comment>
