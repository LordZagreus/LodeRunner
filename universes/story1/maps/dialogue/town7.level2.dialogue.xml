								Because I have this beautiful [color=special]heirloom[/color], I don't care about missing out on any of the other great things in this game!

I notice that you haven't yet customized your gameplay controls in the [color=special]pause menu[/color].  You must have an [color=special]heirloom[/color] that you love just as much!

								You have everything, [color=special]$[core.player1.name][/color]:  lots of gold, fame, and even customized controls!

Well, you don't have this beautiful [color=special]heirloom[/color].  I love it so much, and the death of [color=special]Erin[/color] means that I will never, ever have to return it!
