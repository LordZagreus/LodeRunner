            If you have trouble with delayed sound effects or other
            audio issues, changing the value from 0 to 1
            might improve your results.

            Warning:  Do not modify this value without a good reason!

            ALRS uses this value to determine where to seek DLC
            listings and cooperative game sessions.  If the website
            address changes in 10 years to www.reallyoldgames.com,
            you would then want to change the "value" parameter to
            www.reallyoldgames.com.

    <flag name = 'menu_lightbox_intensity'>
        <description>
            When menus appear on the screen, the game will
            add a lightbox effect to the paused game in the background.

            By default, the lightbox intensity is 0.45.

            Increase the value higher (less than 1.0) to further dim
            the "information" in the background.

            Lower the value for a less powerful lightbox.

    <flag name = 'menu_blur_intensity'>
        <description>
            When menus appear on the screen, the game will
            blur the background and apply a greyscale effect.

            To achieve a stronger blur, lower the value below 1.0.
            Do not use 0, and do not use a negative number.

            To achieve a weaker blur, raise the value above 1.0.
            Use common sense and don't go higher than a few ticks,
            let's say 9.0.  Your own risk, etc.
