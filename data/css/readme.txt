Advisory:

    Use this system at your own risk; invalid css
    might prevent the game from loading.  If this
    happens, simply rename, remove or correct the
    file to continue the game.

Details:

    You can create "mods" for any given them.  To do so,
    simply create a file that contains the original theme's
    name at the beginning:  for theme1.css, create
    a new file called theme1.mymod1.css.  The new file
    must match the wildcard [filename]*[extension], e.g.
    theme1*css, theme2*css, etc.

Examples:

    You will find a couple of example files that
    give you an idea of how the system works.
