Lode Runner was first released back in the 1980s. It was shit. I made it godlike. God bless Doug Smith,may his soul rest in 
pepperonis. 

YES, THIS IS A REMAKE. BUT IT'S ABOUT AS DIFFERENT AS POKEMON FIRERED WAS FROM RED.

Enjoy. Game coded in python using pygame library, simply download and run loderunner.exe to play. Feel free to pull and make your
own improvements.

/u/dat_acid_w0lf's (MagikarpSlayer)(BidoofJason) remake improved the GUI, enemy AI, added 16-bit colorization, that sweet 
juicy 60 fps, and a nice ambient track.

Credits to /u/BurntSaltyPotato (McAntElon) for help with programming, literally all the spritework and finding that one bug 
that no one else could.

Credit to /u/tristanpete (Tristan1000) for keeping $100 worth of late-night redbull. Also suggestions for quests, and in-game 
improvements.
