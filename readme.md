<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>1.  Running the game on your computer</h2>

    <h3>Windows</h3>

    <p>
        If you are using a Windows computer, you can begin <i>A Lode Runner Story</i> by running the <b>loderunner.exe</b> application file.
        The game should begin in windowed mode immediately.  (For information on how to switch to fullscreen mode, <a href = '#av'>click here</a>.)
    </p>

    <p><i>Note for advanced users:  If you want to run the game from source, you can follow the directions for Linux users.</i></p>

    <h3>Linux (or, running from source)</h3>

    <p>
        Before running the game, you must ensure that you have the following packages installed on your linux distribution:
    </p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Package Name</th>
                    <td>in Ubuntu...</td>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>python (version 2.x)</td>
                    <td>Depends</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>pygame</td>
                    <td>python-pygame</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>pyopengl</td>
                    <td>python-opengl</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
            <tfoot>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan = '2'><i>Example for Ubuntu users:  sudo apt-get install <b>python-pygame</b></i></td>
                </tr>
            </tfoot>
        </table>

    <p>
        To begin the game, use Python to run the <b>main.py</b> script.  Your command should look like this:
    </p>

        <blockquote>python main.py</blockquote>

    <p>
        <i>Note:  To view a short list of optional command line arguments, run main.py and include the --help argument.
        The program will list the command line arguments and then exit.</i>
    </p>


<a name = 'solo'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>2.  Single Player</h2>

    <p>
        When you first begin the game, you will see a menu with a small number of selections.
        To jump right into a game, select <b>Play Solo</b>!
    </p>

    <h3>Playing the Main Storyline</h3>

    <div style = 'float: left;'>
        <p>
            When you begin <i>A Lode Runner Story</i>, you will see <b>The Hero of Lelandria</b> at the top of the list.
            Select this option to begin the official storyline mode in <i>A Lode Runner Story</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In <b>The Hero of Lelandria</b>, you must collect gold on over 100 different levels while working to save
            the friendly citizens of <b>Lelandria</b> from their terrible enemies, the <b>Bungeling Empire</b>!
            You will rely on multiple tools on your journey, including bombs, items, and multiple skills that will
            empower you during fight against the bad guys.
        </p>
    </div>
    <img style = 'float: none; margin-left: 1.0em;' src = 'data/misc/readme.solo.png' />

    <br style = 'clear: both;' />

    <h3>Playing other Level Sets</h3>

    <p>
        In addition to the main storyline mode, <i>A Lode Runner Story</i> also includes a number of level sets to challenge
        your mining laser mastery.  These level sets, along with any new level sets you choose to download using the
        <a href = '#dlc'><b>Level Browser</b></a>, offer a more traditional Lode Runner experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        After selecting a non-storyline level set, the game will take you to a level selection screen.  Here, you can view which
        levels you have previously completed.  Select any level to begin a game at that position.
    </p>
    <br />


<a name = 'coop'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>3.  Cooperative Mode</h2>

    <p>
        Many of the additional level sets in <i>A Lode Runner Story</i> support 2 or more players.
        You can play these levels with one or more friends over the internet.  For more information
        about setting up games or joining games, <a href = '#server'>click here</a>.
    </p>
    <br />


<a name = 'basic'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>4.  Basic Gameplay</h2>

    <h3>Collect the Gold</h3>

    <p>
        You have one primary goal in <i>A Lode Runner Story</i>:  collect the gold!
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <h3>Storyline Levels</h3>

    <p>
        When you are playing storyline levels, you do not need to collect every last
        piece of gold before entering the next level.  Indeed, many of the levels
        explicitly require you to move to another level in order to obtain hard-to-reach
        pieces of gold.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can always return to previous levels to finish collecting the gold you left behind!
    </p>

    <h3>Additional Levels</h3>

    <p>
        When you are playing additional level sets, you must collect all of the gold on the
        current level to advance to the next level.  As soon as you collect the final piece,
        all of the bad guys will explode, and the game will automatically send you to the
        next level.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <br />


<a name = 'save'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>5.  Saving Your Progress</h2>

    <h3>Autosaves (Storyline Mode)</h3>

    <p>
        Each time you step into a new level, <i>A Lode Runner Story</i> will automatically save
        your progress.  If you have collected several pieces of gold and you do not wish to lose
        your progress by dying, you can quickly change levels to force an easy autosave!
    </p>

    <h3>Custom Saves (Storyline Mode)</h3>

    <p>
        In addition to the autosave system, <i>A Lode Runner Story</i> also allows you to
        save your game manually at any time.
    </p>

    <p>
        To save your game, press <b>ESC</b> to open the game's pause menu.  From there, move your
        cursor down to the "Save Game" option and select it.  You can choose to save to a <b>quicksave</b>
        slot, or you can choose to save the game with a special title (for example, <i>My Save Game 1</i>).
    </p>
    <br />

<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>6.  Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) and Bad Guys</h2>

    <h3>NPCs</h3>

    <div style = 'float: left;'>
        <p>
            When playing storyline missions such as <b>The Hero of Lelandria</b>, you will meet
            friendly NPCs in the town areas.  NPCs move slowly, and you will see the character's
            name above them as they stroll around town.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can <b>talk</b> to NPCs by standing near them.  If an NPC has a special symbol
            above their name, that symbol indicates that the NPC has special options available.
        </p>
    </div>
    <img style = 'float: none; margin-left: 1.0em;' src = 'data/misc/readme.npc.png' />
    <br style = 'clear: both;' />

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

    <h3>Bad Guys</h3>

    <div style = 'float: left;'>
        <p>
            Watch out for the bad guys that will ceaselessly chase you around the levels!
            Yes, they look exactly like the friendly people you meet in town, but they do
            not like you!
        </p>

        <p>
            You can use your <b>mining laser</b> to trap bad guys in the ground for a short
            period of time.  Soon, though, the bad guy will climb out of the trap and resume
            his pursuit.  If the bad guy ever dies, he will soon reappear near the top of the level.
            You can not permanently defeat enemies!
        </p>
    </div>
    <img style = 'float: none; margin-left: 1.0em;' src = 'data/misc/readme.badguy.png' />
    <br style = 'clear: both;' />
    <br />


<a name = 'digging'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>7.  Mining Laser</h2>

    <p>
        To reach all of the gold in each level, you will have to make extensive use of your
        <b>mining laser</b>.  By default, the <b>Z</b> key on your keyboard will dig to your
        left, and the <b>V</b> key will dig to your right.  (For information on how to
        customize your controls, <a href = '#controls'>click here</a>.)
    </p>

    <p>
        You can dig as many holes as you wish, but you must observe that anything you dig
        will "reappear" in a matter of seconds!  If you are standing in the way of a part
        of the level that finishes reappearing, you will die!
    </p>
    <br />


<a name = 'bombs'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>8.  Bombs</h2>

    <h3>An Optional Solution</h3>

    <p>
        Fact:  you can complete all of the main levels<sup>1</sup> within the first storyline mission
        (<b>The Hero of Lelandria</b>) using nothing more than your <b>mining laser</b>.  (As a bonus,
        you can expect extra XP points for each level you complete without using a bomb.)
    </p>

    <p>
        Bombs offer you an optional alternative.  To obtain bombs, you must either obtain them
        from certain <b>NPCs</b> or purchase them from <b>bomb vending machines</b> for a few
        pieces of gold.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you have obtained a bomb, you can place it by pressing the <b>B</b> key on your keyboard
        (default key).  You must face your character in the direction you wish to bomb.  After placing the
        bomb, make sure to get out of the way quickly, as bombs destroy anything in their surrounding area!
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup><i>Many of the <b>puzzle levels</b> do explicitly require you to use bombs to collect all
                of the gold.</i>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <br />


<a name = 'items'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>9.  Items</h2>

    <div style = 'float: left;'>
        <p>
            As you complete quests and finish puzzle rooms, you will begin to put together a large inventory
            of helpful <b>items</b>.  These items can alter your gameplay experience in many ways:  some will
            slow down enemies, others will reduce the cooldown time for your skills, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            You must equip an item in the <b>pause menu</b> before it will take effect in the game.
            You can only use <b>2</b> items at a time.  Choose carefully!
        </p>
    </div>
    <img style = 'float: none; margin-left: 1.0em;' src = 'data/misc/readme.items.png' />
    <br style = 'clear: both;' />

    <br />


<a name = 'skills'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>10.  Skills / Abilities</h2>

    <h3>Earning XP to Level Up</h3>

    <div style = 'float: left;'>
        <p>
            Each time you complete a level (by collecting all of the gold), you will earn a set amount of
            XP points.  (You can also earn XP points by successfully completing quests for NPCs.)
        </p>

        <p>
            As you continue to earn XP, the XP bar at the top of the screen will show your progress
            toward the next character level.  Leveling up your character will earn you skill points
            that can make your character more powerful!
        </p>
    </div>
    <img style = 'float: none; margin-left: 1.0em;' src = 'data/misc/readme.skills.png' />
    <br style = 'clear: both;' />

    <h3>Unlocking and Upgrading Skills</h3>

    <p>
        Once you have obtained a skill point, you can visit the skills page in the <b>pause menu</b>.
        Here, you will see 6 different skill categories.  Each category offers you a choice of 2 skills,
        but <b>you can only select one of the two</b>!  You must carefully consider your playstyle
        before committing to the skill of your choice.
    </p>

    <p>
        After you have unlocked a skill, you can upgrade it to increase its power.  Each upgrade requires
        another skill point.
    </p>

    <h3>Equipping Skills</h3>

    <p>
        Unlocking a skill does not automatically equip that skill.  After you unlock a skill,
        you must move to the <b>Game</b> tab in the <b>pause menu</b>.  There, you can choose
        the <b>Equip Skills</b> option to view a list of your available skills and then to assign
        them to one of your 2 available skill keys.
    </p>
    <br />


<a name = 'quests'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>11.  Quests</h2>

    <h3>Quest Rewards</h3>

    <p>
        Many of the NPCs in <i>A Lode Runner Story</i> will offer you optional quests.  You do not
        have to complete these quests, but doing so will earn you XP points and additional rewards
        such as items, gold, and the like.
    </p>

    <h3>A Self-Aware World</h3>

    <p>
        You have a lot of freedom when working to complete quests, but the actions you take will
        often have consequences.  Completing a quest exactly as one NPC asks might make the NPC very
        happy, whereas prematurely killing someone along the way might get you in hot water!
    </p>
    <br />


<a name = 'dlc'></a>
<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>12.  Level Browser</h2>

    <h3>Download New Levels</h3>

    <div style = 'float: left;'>
        <p>
            You should periodically monitor the <b>Level Browser</b> for additional level sets!  Download
            new levels that will continue to refine your <i>Lode Runner</i> abilities.
        </p>

        <h3>Level Updates / Fixes</h3>

        <p>
            Sometimes you might find an update to a level set that you have already downloaded.
            If this programmer found a bug in one of the levels, you would find the updated version
            in the <b>Level Browser</b>.  You can safely re-download the level set at any time;
            the game uses a separate file to keep track of your overall progress.
        </p>

<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>13.  Controls</h2>

    <h3>Customizing Your Keyboard Controls</h3>

    <p>
        Use this section to set up the keyboard controls exactly how you like them.
        To customize a control, press <b>ENTER</b> to bring up the "press any key"
        popup, and then press the key you want to use for the selected action.
    </p>

    <h3>Switching between Multiple Gamepads/Joysticks</h3>

    <p>
        If you have more than one gamepad attached to your computer, you can
        use this option to specify which of the devices you prefer to use when
        playing <i>A Lode Runner Story</i>.  The game will remember your selection
        and attempt to use it again the next time you begin the game.
    </p>

    <h3>Customizing Your Gamepad Controls</h3>

    <p>
        Use this section to customize your gamepad controls just as you might have

<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>14.  Audio and Video Settings</h2>

    <h3>Background Music and Sound Effects Volume</h3>

    <p>
        You can control the volume level of the background music and the sound effects
        separately.  Move the bar to the left for a lower volume; move eit to the right
        for a higher volume.
    </p>

    <h3>Fullscreen Mode</h3>

    <p>
        You can play the game in either windowed mode or fullscreen mode.  The game
        will remember your selection and use it again the next time you start the game.
    </p>

    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

    <p>
        If switching to fullscreen mode fails for any reason and the game refuses to
        start (because it is attempting to start in fullscreen mode), you might need
        to edit the <b>preferences.xml</b> file, located in the folder called <b>user</b>.
        Find the following line:
    </p>

        <blockquote>&lt;fullscreen&gt;1&lt;/fullscreen&gt;</blockquote>

    <p>
        You can either change the <b>1</b> to a <b>0</b>, or you can delete the line entirely.
        Doing either will force the game to return to windowed mode.

<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>15.  Language Setting</h2>

    <p>
        <i>A Lode Runner Story</i> aims to support a variety of languages.  Select any of the available languages to
        view text in that locale.
    </p>

    <h3>Help!  I Accidentally Changed the Language!</h3>

    <p>
        If you switch to a language that you cannot understand, you will need to
        edit the <b>preferences.xml</b> file, located in the folder called <b>user</b>.
        Find the following line:
    </p>

        <blockquote>&lt;language&gt;##&lt;/language&gt;</blockquote>

    <p>
        You can either change the <b>##</b> to <b>en</b> (english), or you can delete the line entirely.
        Doing either will force the game to start in the default language.
    </p>

    <h3>The Game doesn't Include My Language!</h3>

    <p>
        If you are looking for translations for a language that does not exist in the game,
        please e-mail <b>aloderunnerstory@gmail.com</b> with your request.  I will let you know if I can help!

<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>16.  Starting a New Game</h2>

    <p>
        To create a new lobby for a cooperative mode session, you should begin
        by selecting <b>Host Game</b> within the Co-op Mode menu.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, you will select which level set to use for the new session.
        After you select a level set, you will then select the specific
        level you wish to begin on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, you can configure whether or not the game requires a password
        and how many players can join the session.  If the game requires a password,
        new players will need to know your password before they can join.

    <p>
        To searching for an existing game which you can join, you should begin
        by selecting <b>Join Game</b> within the Co-op Mode menu.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here you will see a list of all available game sessions.  <b>Public</b>
        games will allow you to join freely, but <b>Private</b> games will require
        you to provide a password before you can join.
    </p>

    <p>
        If no game session appears in the list, you will need to create a new
        session and invite your friends to join you.

    <h3>Text Chat</h3>

    <p>
        You can chat with other players to develop strategies for completing each level!
        By default, press the <b>TAB</b> key to activate the "text typing" console, then
        type your message to the other players in the game.  Press <b>ENTER</b> to send
        your message!
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            If you have access to an external voice chat program such as <b>Skype</b>,
            you can communicate with your friends even more easily!

    <h3>Reviving Fallen Comrades</h3>

    <div style = 'float: left;'>
        <p>
            If you or one of your teammates dies during the level, a special <b>heart</b>
            will appear somewhere within the level.  If any remaining player touches the
            heart, the dead player comes back to life.  However, if all of the players
            die at the same time, you will have to retry the level from the beginning.

    <p>
        You can stand on a teammate's head to collect hard-to-reach pieces of gold!
        Use this technique to solve cooperative puzzles.  Notice, too, that you can

<h2><span><a href = '#top'>Back to Top</a></span>20.  Port Forwarding</h2>

    <h3>Do I Need to Do This?</h3>

    <p>
        If you connect to the internet using a router, you might!  If your friends do not have
        problems connecting to your game, you can skip this section; if your friends report
        problems connecting, then you might need to forward one or more ports on your router.
    </p>

    <h3>How Do I Forward Ports?</h3>

    <p>
        This process will vary depending on the make and model of your particular router.
        In most cases, you will begin by visiting an address in your <b>internet browser</b>
        that resembles 192.168.0.1.  (Remember, your router will have its own instructions!)
        You will need to know your router's username and password to access its configuration screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you have successfully accessed your router's configuration screen, you should
        see an option called "Port Forwarding" or something similar.  (This may vary depending
        on your router model.)  Selecting this option will take you to the port forwarding screen.
    </p>

    <h3>Which Ports Should I Forward?</h3>

    <p>
        By default, <i>A Lode Runner Story</i> attempts to use <b>port 8589</b> when creating
        a new cooperative game session.  If the game for any reason cannot use that port,
        it will try the next port (8590), the next port (8591), and so on until it reaches
        <b>port 8599</b>.  If the game cannot use any of the ports in this range, it will give
        up and return to the main menu.
    </p>

    <p>
        To successfully host a game session on your router, you should at the very least forward
        <b>port 8589</b> to your computer.  Forwarding the entire possible range (8589-8599) will
        ensure that other players can still join your session when the game uses one of the backup ports.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            If you want to change the default port, you can edit the <b>netplay.xml</b> file, located
            in the folder called <b>user</b>.  Locate the <b>&lt;default-port&gt;</b> setting and
            change the port to your preferred port.  (The game will use the same +10 port logic
            starting at the new port.)
        </p>
